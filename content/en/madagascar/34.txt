Wow. I've never heard that one before.
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!
Break out the wave!
Excuse me.
You're biting my butt.
- No, I'm not.<br />- Yes, you are.
- What did you do?<br />- You just bit me!
No. I didn't. Did I?
- You kind of did.<br />- He just bit me on the butt!
What the heck is wrong with you?
Why'd you bite me?
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.<br />- What?
- Excuse me?<br />- That's dumb.
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple<br />bite on the buttocks among friends?
Here, give me a nibble.
The party is over, Julien.<br />Your brilliant plan has failed.
What are you talking about?
Your friend here is what we call
a deluxe-model hunting<br />and eating machine.
And he eats steak, which is you.
- Get out of here.<br />- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.
The plan failed.
All is lost! We're all doomed.
The foosas will come back and<br />gobble us with their mouths because
we are all steak.
I'm steak! Me, me, me!
Mr Alex cannot stay here.
He belongs with his own kind<br />on the foosa side of the island.
By the power vested in me,
by the law of the jungle,<br />blah, blah, blah, blah...
- Be gone!<br />- What?
Come on, do I look like a steak to you?
Yeah!
See, I told you I don't look like a...<br />Wait. What you say?
Oh, yeah!
- He's going savage.<br />- Run for your lives.
Marty, run!
- A bull's eye. Excellent shot, Maurice.<br />- Thank you.
I'm so sorry, Marty.
What is wrong with me?
Oh, no.
What have I done?<br />It's true. I'm a monster.
I got to get out of here.
