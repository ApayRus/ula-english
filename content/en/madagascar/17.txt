Marty? Melman? Gloria?
Marty!
Melman! Gloria!
Hey, anyone! Hello!
Marty, Melman, Gloria.
Gloria, Melman, Marty.<br />Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.
Matt, Katie, Al.
Get me out of this thing.<br />Somebody. Hello?
Get me out of this thing right now!
Hello? Somebody?
Melman!
Alex? Is that you?
Melman, I got you. Hang on! Hang on.<br />I got you.
Melman! I got you, buddy.
Wait a sec, Melman. Wait right there.
- What are you doing?<br />- I'm getting you out of the box.
- Relax.<br />- Alex?
Giraffe, corner pocket!
Here goes nothing!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.<br />- Hold still!
- Wait, Alex.<br />- Hold still.
- No, come on.<br />- Here I come!
Look! Look! Look! Look!
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.
Oh, my...
Gloria!
Gloria!
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.
Gloria!
Alex!
- Marty!
Yeah! All right! That's right!
Left! Left! Left. No, no, your left!<br />Your left! Your left!
Right here's good.
I don't have anything on me right now.<br />I'll have to get you later.
To you too.
Marty! Marty!
Alex!
- Alex!
- Al!
Marty!
Alex?
Marty!
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.
- Hold up! <br />- I'm going to kill you!
- Come here! Don't run away from me!<br />- Calm down!
If you keep running,<br />I'm going to just kill you more!
Oh, look at us.
We're all here together.<br />Safe and sound.
Yeah, here we are.
Where exactly is "here"?
- San Diego.<br />- San Diego?
White sandy beaches,
cleverly simulated natural environment,<br />wide-open enclosures.
I'm telling you,<br />this could be the San Diego Zoo.
Complete with fake rocks.
Wow, that looks real.
San Diego?<br />What could be worse than San Diego?
I don't know.<br />This place is crackalacking!
Oh, I could hang here.<br />I could hang here.
- I'll kill you!<br />- Take it easy!
- Strangle you!<br />- Calm down.
Then bury you, dig you up,<br />clone you and kill your clones.
- 20-second timeout.<br />- I'll never talk to you again.
Now, look.<br />We're just going to find the people,
get checked in<br />and have this mess straightened out.
Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego.
Now I'll have to compete with Shamu<br />and his smug little grin.
I can't top that. Can't top it.
I'm ruined! I'm done.<br />I'm out of the business.
It's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me.
Come on, Alex. Do you honestly think<br />I intended all of this to happen?
You want me to say that I'm sorry?<br />Is that what you want?
Okay, I'm...
He just shushed me.
Marty, look, you've got to be<br />just a little bit more und..
- Don't you shush me.<br />- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?
