It's the Man.
Good evening, officers.
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?
You're not good<br />with the "putting words together
"and their coming out good" thing.<br />You keep it "shh."
Hey! How you doing? You know what?<br />Everything's cool.
We just had a little situation here.<br />Little internal situation.
My friend went a little crazy.<br />Happens to everybody.
The city gets to us all.<br />Went a little cuckoo in the head.
Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head.
Just shush! I will handle this.
Oh! I got him!
Go, go, go! Right here, please.
Would you give a guy a break?
We'll take my little friend home and<br />forget this ever happened. All right?
No harm, no foul, right?
Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion.<br />From the zoo.
What's the matter with them?
I feel really, really weird.
I love you guys.
I love you so much.
