Oh. Gloria.
That was not me, okay?<br />That was the boat.
- The boat!<br />- The boat?
The boat's come back for us!<br />Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.
There it is!
- Hey, over here!<br />- Over here!
Over here! Yo!
Melman, give me a lift. Hurry up!<br />Lift me up!
Help! Help! Help!
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.<br />- Over here!
- Melman! Steady. This way!<br />- You have no idea how much this hurts.
Hey, boat! We're over here!
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!<br />It's coming back!
Come on! Come on, baby!
Yes! You guys.
You flag down that boat. I'll get Alex.
Whoa! Hold on there.
You cannot go back there by yourself.
Come on. I know Alex.
He hears we're rescued,<br />he'll snap right out of it.
The people are coming.<br />They can help us.
Melman's right.<br />The people will know what to do.
Now, we got to flag down that boat.
Now, this is more like it.
You? Oh, ma... Where are the people?
We killed them and ate their livers.
Got you, didn't I?
Just kidding, doll, the people are fine.
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.
Hey, I know you two.
Where's that psychotic lion<br />and our monochromatic friend?
Marty? He's righ... Where did he go?<br />He was right behind us.
He went back for Alex.<br />He's going to get himself killed!
Well, boys,<br />our monochromatic friend's in danger.
Looks like we have a job to do.
Captain's log:<br />Embarking into hostile environment.
Kowalski. We'll need to win the hearts<br />and the minds of the natives.
Rico. We'll need<br />special tactical equipment.
We're going to face extreme peril.
Private probably won't survive.
