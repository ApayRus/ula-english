- It's Marty's birthday.<br />- Just rip it open.
- What is it?<br />- Come on. Open it up. What you got?
A thermometer.
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.
I wanted to give you<br />something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.
- Mother<br />- I'll miss that bad boy.
Get the cake. Melman, come on.
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>You live in a zoo</i>
<i>You look like a monkey</i>
<i>And you smell like one too</i>
Well, now, you guys are just embarrassing me.
And yourselves.
What? We worked on that all week.
Let's go. Let's make a wish, babycakes.
- What'd you wish for?<br />- Nope. Can't tell you that.
Come on. Tell.
No siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck.
You want some bad luck, I'll blab it out.
But if you want to be safe,<br />I'll keep my mouth shut.
Would you just tell us?<br />What could happen?
Okay.
I wished I could go to the wild!
The wild?
