I know. And then...
- It's him.<br />- Who is it?
It's the pizza man.<br />Who the heck do you think it is?
Yes? Can I help you?
Can I come to the fun side?
Beg your pardon?
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.
But I've been thinking<br />about what you said, and I'm sorry.
Welcome to Casa del Wild.<br />Take a load off.
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.
- Alex!<br /><i>- Mi casa is su casa.</i>
Very impressive.
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.
This is seawater.
Oh, you don't swallow it.
It's just temporary<br />till the plumbing's done.
Hey, y'all look hungry.
How would you like<br />some of nature's goodness?
You have food?
The Fun Side Special, coming up.
Seaweed on a stick.
Seaweed?
On a stick. Don't love it till you try it.
That's unbelievable.
- So good.<br />- Well, thanks.
It does kind of hit the spot, doesn't it?
Well, maybe it could use a little lemon.
No, it's great. It's really great.<br />Doesn't get any better than this.
Oh, but it does.
Check this out.
Wow. Would you look at that.
It's like billions and billions<br />of helicopters.
It's a shooting star. Make a wish. Quick!
How about a thick, juicy steak?
You know what, Alex?
I promise you I'm going to find you<br />a steak tomorrow if it kills me.
Thanks, Marty.
It is getting late. I guess I'm going to...
I think I'm going to hit the sack too.
Sweet dreams, everyone.
