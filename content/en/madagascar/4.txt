Just smile and wave, boys.<br />Smile and wave.
Kowalski, progress report.
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.
- And the bad news?<br />- We've broken our last shovel.
Right.
Rico, you're on litter patrol.<br />We need shovels.
And find more Popsicle sticks.<br />We don't want to risk another cave-in.
And me, Skipper?
I want you<br />to look cute and cuddly, Private.
Today we're going to blow this dump.
Come here. Come here.<br />Come on, penguin.
