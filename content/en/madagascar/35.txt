What have I done? This is a nightmare.
And it's all my fault.
Now, because of me, we've lost Alex.
Well, what are we going to do?
We'll find a way to help him.<br />That's what we'll do.
Okay.
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?
We're tough. We're gritty.<br />We're adaptable!
And we are not going to lay down<br />like a bunch of Melmans.
No, we're not.
