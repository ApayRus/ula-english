Alex! Come out, Alex!
The boat's here! We can go home!
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!
Alex! Alex! Alex!
Alex! Alex! Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Snap out of it, Alex.
The boat came back.<br />We can get out of here.
We can go back to civilisation,<br />and everything will be like it used to be.
Stay back.
Please.
I'm a monster.
Alex, you're no monster.<br />You're my friend.
We're a team. You and me, remember?
I don't want to hurt you.
Alex.
I ain't leaving without you.
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.
It's a wonderful song.<br />I'm sure you're familiar with it.
<i>Start spreadin' the news</i>
<i>I'm leaving today</i>
<i>We are a great big part of it</i>
Come on, you know the words.<br />Two little words.
Please don't make me<br />sing this by myself.
You really don't want to hear me<br />sing this by myself.
