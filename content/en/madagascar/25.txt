Well, since I'm doomed to die<br />on this forsaken island,
I, Melman Mankiewicz,
being of sound mind and unsound body,
have divided my estate equally<br />among the three of you.
Sorry, Alex.
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.<br />Outdoor plumbing.
No, it's not a latrine. It's a grave.
You sent Melman to his grave.<br />Are you happy?
Come on.
This isn't the end.<br />This is a whole new beginning.
This could be the best that's happened.
No. No. No. No.<br />No. No. No. No. No. No.
This is not the best thing<br />that's happened to us.
You abused the power of the birthday wish
and brought bad luck on all of us.
Why'd you tell your wish?<br />You're not supposed to.
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?
- You guys made me tell you.<br />- Oh, okay.
Besides, this isn't bad luck.<br />This is good luck.
Look around.<br />There's no fences, no schedules.
This place is beautiful.<br />Baby, we were born...
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.
This is your side of the island,<br />and this is our side of the island.
That is the bad side,<br />where you can prance and skip
like a magical pixie horse<br />and do whatever the heck you want.
This is the good side<br />for those who love New York
and care about going home.
- Come on.<br />- No, no. Back! Back!
You know what? This isn't good.
Okay! You all have your side,<br />and I'll have mine.
And if you need me, I'll be over here,
on the fun side of the island,<br />having a good old time.
This is the fun side,
where we'll have a great time surviving<br />until we go home.
- A yabbadabbado old time!<br />- This side's the best.
That side stinks!
You're on the Jersey side<br />of this cesspool!
- Wilma!<br />- Now what do we do?
Don't worry.<br />I have a plan to get us rescued.
