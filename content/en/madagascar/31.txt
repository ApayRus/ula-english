You see, Maurice,<br />Mr Alex was grooming his friend.
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.
How can you have the heebie-jeebies<br />for Mr Alex?
Look at him. He's so cute and plushy.
I don't think he was grooming him.
Look more like<br />he was tasting him to me.
Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care.
Soon we will<br />put my excellent plan to action.
All we have to do is wait<br />until they are deep in their sleep.
How long is this going to take?
