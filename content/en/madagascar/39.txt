- Close those eyes.<br />- Why do I have to?
- Do it.<br />- They're closed.
- Tighter.<br />- Yes, sir.
- No peeking.<br />- They're closed.
Rico.

Open that hatch.
Fire in the hole. Now chew.
Chew like you mean it. Savour it.
- And?<br />- Well?
Pretty good, right?
There's always Plan B.
This is better than steak.
I love it. I love it!
The kitty loves the fishy.
Well, I propose a toast.
Now, he may be<br />a pain in the butt at times...
And trust me, I know.
But this cat proved to me<br />without a doubt
that his heart is bigger<br />than his stomach.
- To Alex.<br />- To Alex.
Enough! Stop it!
What do you think?<br />Should we head back to New York?
I don't know. I mean, this is your dream.<br />You sure you want to leave?
I don't care where we are.
As long as we're together,<br />it doesn't matter to me.
Well, in that case...
Yo. Rico. I'll take 300 orders to go.

But before you leave,<br />I have an announcement to make.
So shut up, everyone, please.<br />Thank you.
After much deep and profound<br />brain things inside my head,
I have decided to thank you<br />for bringing peace to our home.
And to make you feel good,
I'm going to give you<br />this lovely parting gift.
No, I couldn't.<br />Really, I can't take your crown.
That's okay, I've got a bigger crown.
It's got a gecko on it.
Look at him shake. Go, Stevie, go!
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!<br />- Thanks for everything!
- So long!<br />- Bye-bye, now.
<i>- Arrivederci.</i><br />- Bye-bye.
- Toodle-oo!<br />- See you later, crocodile.
Maurice, my arm is tired.<br />Wave it for me.
Faster, you naughty little monkey.
By the time we get back to New York,<br />it'll be the middle of winter.
So I was just thinking, why rush?
Maybe we could make<br />a few side stops along the way.
- You just read my mind.
- I was thinking Spain.<br />- Run with the bulls.
- What about Fiji?<br />- Canada. Can we?
Cheap meds.
I wouldn't even mind<br />coming back here sometime.
- I could do that.<br />- You could say that again.
- Skipper?<br />- I always wanted to go to Australia.
Don't you think we should tell them<br />that the boat's out of gas?
Nan. Just smile and wave, boys.<br />Smile and wave.
