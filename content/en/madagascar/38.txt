Alex? Could you come out here<br />for a minute?
Hey, Alex, a little help.
Help me!
Alex! Help!
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!
Help!
- Melman?<br />- That's right, baby.
Run!
- What's the plan?<br />- This is the plan.
- Foosa hungry.<br />- Foosa eat.
This is the plan?
Foosa halt.
Ooh.
Foosa aaahh.
Foosa ooh.
Foosa aaahh.
Come and get it.
Foosa.
- Take that.<br />- Foosa ow!
There's too many of them, Skipper.
It's been a real pleasure<br />serving with you boys.
Alex?
That's my kill.
Mine.
Alex hungry.
Alex eat.
It's showtime.
Thanks for not giving up on me.
Man, you almost<br />gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.
Just because you're a lion...<br />Let go of me. Let go of me.
We're getting out of here.<br />Guys, just go with me on this.
Like I said, it's showtime.
Mine.
My kill.
They're all mine.
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!
- Don't eat me!<br />- He's big and scary!
Fear me!<br />Savagery beyond comprehension.
- I am far too young to die!<br />- You're a monster! A monster, I say!
- And, you!<br />- Me?
Oh, you want some of this?<br />You better run for your lives.
- Somebody call a cop!<br />- He's psychotic!
This is my territory. Understand?
I never, ever<br />want to see you on my turf again.
Boo.
Yeah! You the cat!
Got my boy back!
I did it!
Give me some love! The plan worked!<br />The plan worked! I'm very clever!
I'm the one, baby! Come on.<br />Time to robot.
I am very clever king.
I am super genius.
I am robot king of the monkey things.
- Compute, compute.<br />- So, what's for lunch?
