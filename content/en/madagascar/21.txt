- Maurice, did you see that?<br />- He scared the foosa away.
Come on, Gloria. Get it.
Get it! Get it! Get it!
- That's it! Smack it!<br />- Get it, get it!
Whip it! Whip it good! Where'd it go?
King Julien, what are they?<br />What are they?
They are aliens.<br />Savage aliens from the savage future.
They've come to kill us.
And take our women.<br />And our precious metals.
Get up, Mort.<br />Do not be near the king's feet, okay?
We're hiding. Be quiet, everyone.<br />Including me.
Who's making that noise?<br />Oh, it's me again.
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!
- Enough! Enough with the stick.<br />- I think she got it.
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.
It's okay. It's gone.
They are savages.
Tonight we die.
The feet. I told you... I told you to...<br />I told every...
Didn't I tell him about the feet?
He did tell you about the feet.
- Wait. I have a plan.<br />- Really?
I have devised a cunning test<br />to see whether these are savage killers.
Hi there.
You let me handle it. Alex handles it.<br />Marty does nothing.
Hi there.
Oh, jeez. Sorry.
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?<br />- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.<br />Oh, jeez!
- Alex!<br />- Oh, you poor little baby.
Did that big mean lion scare you?
He did?<br />He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he?
Come on. Mama'll hold you.<br />Look at you.
They are so cute<br />from a reasonable distance.
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.<br />I just want to dunk him in my coffee.
They're just a bunch of pansies.
I don't know.
There's something about that one<br />with the crazy hairdo
that I find suspicious.
Nonsense, Maurice.
Come on, everybody.<br />Let's go and meet the pansies!
