Wake up, Mr Alex.
Wake up, Mr Alex.
Rise and shining.
Wakey-waking, Mr Alex!
Wake up! Alex!
You suck your thumb?
Where are we?<br />What the heck is going on?
What do you think? Take it easy.
- Who built a forest?<br />- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.
While you were asleep,
we simply took you<br />to our little corner of heaven.
Welcome to Madagascar.
- Mada-who-ah?<br />- What?
No, not whooha. Ascar.
Marty. It's...
Just like my mural back at the zoo.
Oh, no, fella,<br />that is the real deal right there.
Look at that, that's not a bad view.
That's the thing that you were always<br />looking at, but it's actually there.
- That's the real version of....<br />- How about once around the park?
Let's get our blood pumping,<br />lungs breathing this fresh air.
Who's with me?
Naw. I don't think I couldn't. You're IIS
Hey! Want to play around?
Got you there!
Come here!
You're it.
Hey, stop that! Hey, you're crazy!
Okay, Marty, I'm it. I'm it. I'm it. You win.
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.
I haven't eaten in two days.
My blood sugar's real low.<br />I just don't have the energy.
I don't think that's your problem.
First of all,<br />that's not how you run in the wild.
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!<br />You just have to let out that inner lion.
- Now, who's the cat?<br />- Marty, I really don't...
You are, that's who. Come on!<br />Here we go!
That's it. Let's build up some steam!<br />You the cat.
- Who's the cat?<br />- You the cat.
- Who's the cat?<br />- You the cat.
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?<br />Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?<br />Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
I'm the cat!
Surprise!
You're it. You're it!<br />Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye<br />on the fly from the deli in the sky!
- Let's go wild!<br />- Now you're talking!
Man! I feel different.
Noogie, noogie, noogie.<br />Noogie, noogie, noogie!
Kind of charged up or something.
- Like you said, baby, it's...<br />- Crackalacking.
- Ain't that right, Melman?<br />- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm in heaven.
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend<br />and the foosas are nowhere to be seen.
It could be said that my plan is working<br />in a very good working kind of way.
Alex. You got to try some of this.
I feel good. Feel like a king again.
King?
You should see his act.
Come on, Alex, why don't you<br />show him some of your act?
Oh. No,<br />I really don't think I couldn't Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />Primates of all ages.
The wild proudly presents:
The king.
Alex the lion!
E flat, fellas.
Yeah! The king is in the house!
See, if he is the king,<br />then where is his crown?
I've got a crown.
Got a very nice one.<br />And it's here on my head.
Look at it. Have I got it on?
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.
