Come on.
One of us should wait here<br />in case he comes back.
Not now. This is an intervention.<br />We all got to go.
What's the fastest way<br />to Grand Central?
- You should take Lexington.<br />- Melman!
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.<br />- What about Park?
No, Park goes two ways.<br />You can't time the lights.
I heard Tom Wolfe<br />is speaking at Lincoln Centre.
Well, of course<br />we're going to throw poo at him.
We should've taken Park.
You sure this is the fastest way<br />to Grand Central Station?
I don't know! That's what Melman said.
Hey. Hey, you, guys.
That room has some nifty little sinks<br />you can wash up in, and look!
Free mints!
This isn't a field trip.
This is an urgent mission to save Marty<br />from throwing his life away.
Now, where's the train?
Here it comes.
What did Marty say to you?<br />I asked you to talk to him.
I did! I did! I don't understand.<br />He said, "Let's go."
I said, "Are you crazy?"<br />He says, "I'm ten years old."
And he has black-and-white stripes,<br />and so then we sang and
What you got to do is go straight back<br />down West 42nd.
- It's on your left after Vanderbilt.<br />- Okay.
If you hit the Chrysler Building,<br />you've gone too far.
Thanks a lot, officer.
Hey! Wait for the light.
Freak.
<i>- Did you say "zebra"?</i><br />- That's right. A zebra.
Right in front of me.
- Can I shoot it?<br /><i>- Negative.</i>
Then I'm going to need some backup.
- Knicks lost again.<br />- What are you going to do?
Did that say "Grand Central Station"<br />or "my aunt's constipation"?
This is it.
Grand Central Station.
It's grand and it's central.
Move aside.<br />We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.
Hey, hey. Just chill out.<br />It's not that big of an emergency.
Upstairs, downstairs.
How do you like that?
Lady! What is wrong with you?
Get a grip on yourselves, people.
You're a bad kitty.
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.
Looks like I'll have to take<br />the Stamford local.
I got him! I've got him!
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got him! He's got
I got something for you!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?
- I am so glad we found you.<br />- We were so worried about you.
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.<br />Look at me. I'm fine.
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.
You hear that? Marty's fine.<br />That's good to know.
Because I was wondering
How could you do this to us?<br />I thought we were your friends!
What's the big deal?<br />I was coming back.
Don't ever do this again.<br />Do you hear me?
- Do you hear him?<br />- Guys, we're running out of time.
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?
Don't do this again!<br />Don't you ever, ever do this again!
Come here.
