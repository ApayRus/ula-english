Presenting your royal highness,<br />our illustrious King Julien XIII,
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,<br />et cetera. Hooray, everybody.
He's got style.
What is he, like,<br />king of the guinea pigs?
I think it's a squirrel.
Welcome, giant pansies.
Please feel free to bask in my glow.
- Definitely a squirrel.<br />- Yep. Squirrel.
We thank you with enormous gratitude<br />for chasing away the foosa.
- The "whossa"?<br />- The foosa.
They annoy us by trespassing,<br />interrupting our parties
- and ripping our limbs off.<br />- Good.
We're just trying to find out<br />where the people are, so...
What big teeth you have. Man!
Shame on you, Maurice.
Can you not see<br />that you have insulted the freak?
You must tell me,<br />who the heck are you?
I'm Alex. The Alex.<br />And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.
And just where are you giants from?
We're from New York and...
- All hail the New York giants!<br />- New York giants!
Is this<br />some sort of inbreeding programme?
I say we just got to ask these bozos<br />where the people are.
Excuse me.<br />We bozos have the people, of course.
Hey, the bozos have the people.
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.
They're up there.
Don't you love the people?<br />Not a very lively bunch, though.
Wow.
So do you have any live people?
No. Only dead ones.
I mean,<br />if we had a lot of live people here,
it wouldn't be called the wild, would it?
- The wild?<br />- Whoa.
Hold up there a second, fuzzbucket.
You mean, like,
the "live in a mud hut,<br />wipe yourself with a leaf type wild?
- Who wipes?<br /><i>- Oy vey.</i>
<i>- Oy vey!<br />- Oy vey,</i> everybody!
<i>Oy vey!</i>
Could you excuse me for a moment?
