Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria<br />are over there having a good time.
There's room on the fun side<br />for one more.
No, thanks.
Look, I've been thinking.<br />Maybe if you gave this place a chance,
I don't know,<br />you might even enjoy yourself.
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.
I just want to go home.
Could you just give it a chance?<br />Think about it.
it really isn't the fun side without you.
