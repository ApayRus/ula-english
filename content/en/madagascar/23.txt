Get me out of here!<br />We got to get out of here!
- Help!<br />- What are you doing?
I'm swimming back to New York.
I know my chances are slim,<br />but I have to try!
- You can't swim!<br />- I said my chances are slim!
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off!<br />I can't see! I can't see!
I can see!
Look. There's obviously<br />just been a little mistake.
The people didn't dump us here<br />on purpose.
As soon as they realise what happened,<br />they'll come looking for us, right?
Yeah, right.
<i>I don't know the words<br />But we're born free</i>
You know something?<br />I bet they're already on their way.
