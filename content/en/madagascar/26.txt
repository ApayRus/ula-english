Can't wait to see the look<br />on Marty's face when he sees this.
Just look at him.<br />He's helpless without us.
Shut up, Spalding.
I've been standing here for hours, man.<br />How long do I have to pose like this?
She is <i>finite</i>
I defy any rescue boat<br />within a million miles
to miss this baby.
When the moment is right,<br />we will ignite the beacon of liberty
and be rescued<br />from this awful nightmare!
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?<br />- Great. Idiot.
I heard that.
Why can't we just borrow<br />some of Marty's fire?
That's wild fire.
We're not using wild fire<br />on Lady Liberty.
- Now, rub, Melman.<br />- I've been doing...
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.<br />I ju... I can't do it!
Fire.
Fire.
Fire! Fire!
Oh, my.
Fire!
Not yet! No, no! No!
Fire!
Melman, hold still!
Jump! Alex, jump!
Don't worry, cats always land on their...
Face? Man, what kind of cat are you?
You maniac!
You burnt it up! Darn you!
Darn you all to heck!
Can we go to the fun side now?
