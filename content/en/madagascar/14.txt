Oh, my head.
What the...?
Wait. Where? What?
I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no!<br />Not the box.
Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me!
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
Darkness creeping in.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
Walls closing in around me.
So alone. So alone.
- Alex! Alex, are you there?<br />- Marty?
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.<br />- Oh, Marty! You're here!
- What's going on? You okay?<br />- This doesn't look good.
- Alex, Marty, is that you?<br />- Gloria!
- You're here too!<br />- I am loving the sound of your voice.
- What is going on?<br />- We're all in crates.
Oh, no!
- Sleeping just knocks me out.<br />- Melman!
Is that Melman?
- Are you okay?<br />- Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI.
- You're not getting an MRI.<br />- CAT scan?
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.<br />It's a zoo transfer.
Zoo transfer? Oh, no.<br />No, no, I can't be transferred.
I have an appointment<br />with Dr Goldberg at 5:00.
There are prescriptions<br />that have to be filled.
No other zoo<br />could afford my medical care.
And I am not going HMO.
Take it easy, Melman.<br />It's going to be okay.
- We are going to be okizay.<br />- No, we're not going to be okizay.
Now, because of you, we're ruined!
Because of me?<br />I fail to see how this is my fault.
- You're kidding, right, Marty?<br />- You. You ticked off the people.
You bit the hand, Marty.<br />You bit the hand.
"I don't know who I am.
"I got to go find myself in the wild."<br />Oh, please.
I did not ask you to come after me,<br />did I?
He does have a point.
I did say we should stay at the zoo,<br />but you guys...
Melman, just shut it.
You suggested this idea to him<br />in the first place.
- Leave Melman out of this.<br />- Thank you, Gloria.
Besides, it's not my fault<br />that we were transferred.
Melman, shut it.<br />Does anybody feel nauseous?
- I feel nauseous.<br />- Melman, you always feel nauseous.
