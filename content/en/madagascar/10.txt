We're not all nocturnal, you know!
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?
You mess with him,<br />you mess with me, Howard.
- You're a bigmouth lion.<br />- See? Mr Grumpy Stripes.
We make a great team, the two of us.
We sure do. No doubt about it.
So, what are you going to do?<br />Go running off to the wild by yourself?
- No.<br />- Good.
You and me. Let's go.
- What?<br />- The wild.
Come on. You and me together.
It's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue<br />to Grand Central.
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.
We can be back by morning.<br />No one will ever know.
You're joking. Right?
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking.<br />Give me a break.
Like we're going to get a train.
Don't do that.<br />You really had me worried there.
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.
Yeah, me too.<br />I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow.
It's Seniors' Day, you know.<br />Have to roar extra loud.
Give them a little jolt. You know?
Good night, AllyAl.
They forgot<br />to turn off the ambience again.
Don't worry. It's cool.
You know, I got it.
Much better.
Come on, now, baby.
My little filet.
