Yeah!<br />You don't see that on Animal Planet.
Ha-ha.
Well, show's over, folks.<br />Thanks for coming.
I hope you thought it was fresh.
I'll be here all week.
In fact, I'll be here for my whole life.
Three hundred and sixty-five days<br />a year,
including Christmas, Hanukkah,<br />Halloween, Kwanzaa.
Please don't forget<br />to never spay or neuter your pets.
And tip your cabbie,<br />because he's broke.
You, quadruped.<br /><i>Sprechen sie Englisch?</i>
<i>I sprechen.</i>
- What continent is this?<br />- Manhattan.
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.
What are you guys doing?
We're digging to Antarctica.
Ant-who-tica?
Can you keep a secret,<br />my monochromatic friend?
Do you ever see any penguins<br />running free around New York City?
Of course not. We don't belong here.<br />It's just not natural.
This is all<br />some kind of whacked-out conspiracy.
We're going<br />to the wide-open spaces of Antarctica.
To the wild.
The wild? You could actually go there?
That sounds great.
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?<br />Tell me where it is.
You didn't see anything.
- Right?<br />- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. No, sir.
<i>For his final appearance of the day,<br />the king of New York City.</i>
