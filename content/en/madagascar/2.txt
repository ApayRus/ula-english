Surprise!
Alex. Do not interrupt me<br />when I'm daydreaming.
When a zebra's in the zone,<br />leave him alone.
Come on, Marty. Just wanted<br />to wish you a happy birthday.
Hey, man, thanks.
Hey, I got something stuck in my teeth.
It's driving me crazy.<br />Can you help me? Please?
You came to the right place, my friend.
Dr Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.
Please hop on top of my sterilised<br />examination table, if you may.
- I don't see anything.<br />- It's on the left.
Oh, sorry.
Okay, just don't talk<br />with your mouth full.
Right here.<br />What the heck is this doing in there?
Happy birthday!
Hey, thanks, man.
You put it in behind the tooth.<br />You all right.
These aren't even on the shelf yet.<br />Here. Check it out.
- Look at that. Look at that.<br />- Look at that. It's snowing.
Ten years old, huh? A decade.
Double digits. The big 1-0.
You don't like it?
- No, no, it's great.<br />- You hate it.
I should've gotten you<br />the Alex alarm clock.
That's the big seller.
No, no, no. The present's great, really.
It's just that<br />another year's come and gone
and I'm still doing the same old thing.
"Stand over here. Trot over there.<br />Eat some grass. Walk back over here."
- I see your problem.<br />- Maybe I should go to law school.
You just need to break out<br />of that boring routine.
- Throw out the old act.
Who knows what you'll do.<br />Make it up as you go along.
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.<br />Boom, boom, boom.
- Really?<br />- You know, make it fresh.
Fresh, huh? Okay. I could do fresh.
Works for me.
