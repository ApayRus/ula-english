Everybody, calm down. Come on.<br />Into your chairs.
Everybody, calm down. Let go of his tail.
Separate those two, would you, please?
You here, you there. Everyone
Calm down, people, okay?
Now, presenting your royal highness,<br />the illustrious blah, blah, blah.
You know, et cetera, et cetera. Hooray.<br />Let's go.
Now, everybody,
we all have great curiosity<br />about our guests, the New York giants.
- Yes, Willie?<br />I like them.
I like them. I liked them first.<br />Before I even met them I liked them.
I liked them right away.
You hate them<br />compared to how much I like them.
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!
Now, for as long as we can remember,
we have been attacked<br />and eaten by the dreaded foosa.
The foosa! The foosa are attacking!
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!
Please. Maurice.
Quiet!
Come on, y'all. They're not attacking us<br />this very instant.
So my genius plan is this:
We will make the New York giants<br />our friends and keep them close.
Then, with Mr Alex protecting us,<br />we will be safe
and never have to worry<br />about the dreaded foosa ever again.
I thought of that. I thought of that.<br />Yes. Me. I did.
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.<br />I'm just thinking now.
I mean,<br />does anyone wonder why the foosa
were so scared of Mr Alex?
I mean,<br />maybe we should be scared too.
What if Mr Alex<br />is even worse than the foosa?
I tell you, that dude<br />just gives me the heebiedabajeebies.
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.
Therefore, your heinous comment<br />will be stricken from the record.
Does anyone else<br />have the heebie-jeebies?
No? Good. So shut up.
When the New York giants wake up,
we will make sure<br />that they wake up in paradise.
Now, who would like a cookie?
