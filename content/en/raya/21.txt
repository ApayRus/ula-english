SISU: Ah, this is giving me<br />bad feels.
Chief Dang Hai<br />does not sound like
someone you could smooth talk.
And Raya<br />didn't even bring a gift.
That's it. I'm going shopping.
Oh, wait.<br />I don't have any money.
BOUN: You're an adult.
You could just put it<br />on credit.
Oh... Uh, what's credit?
It's kinda like a promise.
You take what you want now,
and you promise<br />you'll pay it back later.
Pay it back later? Huh!
What an amazing concept.
Thanks, Captain Boun.
-(LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC PLAYING)<br />-(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
SISU: I'll be buying this<br />with credit.
Oh, Dang Hai's<br />gonna love this!
Credit, please.
Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah,<br />I'll be using credit, yes.
I love credit!
MALE MERCHANT: Hey, you!
Are you going<br />to pay for any of that?
Oh! (CHUCKLING)
Right, right.<br />No, this is on credit.
Yeah, I'm gonna pay it<br />back later.
Pay us back later?<br />We don't know you.
You have no credit here.
-Pay us right now.<br />-Now?
(NERVOUSLY)<br />I don't have anything,
but if I could just find<br />my girl Raya,
she has a sword, dried eats,
two Dragon Gem pieces.
No, we don't!<br />What? Who said that?
You better pay up, binturi.
This isn't a charity.
Who do you think<br />you're stealing from?
(EXCLAIMING)<br />Get away from her!
Can't you see<br />she's new in town?
(AFFECTIONATELY)<br />Come, dear. Don't be afraid.
WOMAN: It's okay.
