(OBJECTS SMASHING<br />AND CLATTERING)
(YELLING) Hey! Stop eating!
(ONGIS CHITTERING)
(STARTS)
RAYA: (EXCLAIMS) Whoa!
Sorry, buddy, I got this.
BOUN: Did you just throw<br />a shrimp at me?
That's not even edible!
-RAYA: Hey!<br />-BOUN: Don't look at me...
RAYA: Uh... Hey, guys?
BOUN: ...like that,<br />you fuzzy garbage can!
Do you wanna play<br />hide-and-seek?
All right. Ready?
One.
Two.
-Thanks.<br />-Two and a half.
Three.
Remind me to never have kids.
Being people is hard.
Yep.
Six.
Seven.
You have small heads.
No tails.
You lie to get what you want,
like the Talon chief<br />back there.
Yeah, well,<br />the world's broken.
You can't trust anyone.
Or maybe the world's broken
because you don't<br />trust anyone.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)<br />You sound just like my ba.
Well, he sounds like<br />a smart man.
Yeah, he was.
I really wanted<br />to believe him.
I really wanted to believe
that we could be<br />Kumandra again.
And we can.
Literally thousands of people<br />turned to stone
would argue otherwise.
That doesn't mean<br />you shouldn't try.
And I did.<br />And you know what happened?
I got kicked in the back<br />by someone who gave me a gift.
Look around.
We're a world<br />of orphans because
people couldn't stop fighting<br />over a gem.
Wanna know why other dragons<br />didn't come back?
It's because<br />people don't deserve them.
But you can change that.
No, Sisu, I am done trying.
Kumandra is a fairy tale.
The only thing<br />important to me now
is bringing my ba back.
Um... I think we're in Spine.
(SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
-Sisu!<br />-(SISU GRUNTS)
BOUN: Hey, my congee!
RAYA: Don't go anywhere.<br />I'll be right back.
