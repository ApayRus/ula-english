(SIGHS DEEPLY)
TONG: There's too much spice.
Uh, no.<br />There's too much bamboo.
TONG: What do you know?
You have the taste buds<br />of a tall baby.
Well, you dress like<br />a tall baby.
Give me the spoon!<br />I'm taking over!
Back off, tidal wave.<br />I'm the professional here.
May I?
(SLURPS)
Whoa!
That's good.
RAYA: It's just a little<br />something my ba showed me.
Aw. Did he also show you
how to make<br />that delicious jerky?
(CHUCKLES)<br />No, that was all me.
(CHUCKLES)
It'll be nice to share a meal<br />with him again.
BOUN: I know what you mean.
I have this really<br />obnoxious sister
who always tousles my hair.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I can't wait to see her the most.
After we win the day,
I look forward<br />to filling my eyeball
with the joytastic image<br />of my village full again.
(CON-BABY MUMBLING)
And you will be reunited<br />with your family, Noi.
Uh, what did you just call her?
Noi. It's her name.
(BURPS)
It's written on her collar.
Have none of you ever checked?
And they think of me<br />as the ruffian.
(FLARE WHISTLING)
What's that mean?
It means we're on.
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
Sisu,
until we get that gem
and confirm Namaari's actually<br />on our side,
promise me you'll stay hidden.
