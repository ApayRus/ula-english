(BOTH GRUNTING)
Hello? Is anybody here?
(EXCLAIMS)
(WHIZZING)
Welcome to the world-famous<br />Shrimp-orium.
My name is Boun.<br />I'll be your server today.
Would you like to hear<br />our daily specials?
Yes, please!
We got shrimp, we got congee.
We got a shrimp congee<br />that won't quit.
The captain,<br />where is the captain?
Let me go get him.
What's up, my new customers?
I'm Captain Boun,
the owner, chef,<br />and chief financial officer
of the Shrimp-orium.
How can I help you?
Well, I'm Sisu and...
And we need<br />to get to Talon now.
I'm sorry. The Shrimp-orium<br />is not a water taxi.
-(COINS JINGLE)<br />-Toi, that's a lot of jade!
Half now, half when we arrive<br />in Talon. Deal?
Clasp onto your congee.
Today's special is
to go.
Uh, Captain Boun?
Does this thing go any faster?
(CATS SNARLING)
Whoa! You didn't tell me<br />Fang was after you!
This is gonna cost you extra!
Don't worry, I got it.
(SPLASHES)
What is she doing?

What is happening?
My friend's<br />a really strong swimmer.
(CATS SNARLING)
Bye-bye, binturi.
Princess Namaari,<br />if they're after gem pieces,
their next stop<br />would be Talon.
We're not following them<br />to Talon.
We're going back to Fang.
I need to speak<br />with Chief Virana.
