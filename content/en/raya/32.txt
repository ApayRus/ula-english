RAYA: Where are you taking me?
(ENTHRALLING MUSIC PLAYING)
Sisu, why did you<br />bring me here?
This is where it all happened.
Yeah, I know.
-I was there.<br />-SISU: No.
This is where it all happened<br />500 years ago.
(GASPS SOFTLY)
SISU: I want you to meet<br />my brothers and sisters.
The real mighty ones.
I miss them.
RAYA: I never knew<br />they were here.
See that classy-looking one<br />over there?
That's Amba.<br />I get my glow from her.
And that's Pranee.<br />She's a shapeshifter.
Jagan, fog.
And Pengu.
He's our big brother.
He brings the rain.
We were the last dragons.
(THUNDERING)
SISU: All the other dragons<br />had been turned to stone.
We were drowning<br />in a sea of Druun.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
But my oldest brother Pengu<br />refused to accept defeat.
This is where<br />we'd make our last stand...
united.
So, one by one,
they combined all their magic,
creating the Dragon Gem.
I don't know why<br />they chose me.
It could have been any of us.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES)
All I know
is I trusted them...
(DRUUN RUMBLING)
...and they trusted me.
And so...
(GEM RINGING MYSTICALLY)
When they put their faith<br />in me,
it empowered me beyond<br />anything I could imagine.
The same can happen<br />with Namaari.
I really wish<br />I could believe that.
I once thought<br />that we could be friends.
After all this,
maybe you can be.
Even if she wanted to help us,
how could I possibly<br />trust her?
But if somehow you could,
you wouldn't just bring<br />your ba back.
You'd also bring back<br />his dream.
Kumandra.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXHALES SOFTLY)
Do you think<br />he would even recognize me?
So much has changed.
Of course he will.
You remind me of him.
Oh, yeah? Strong?
Good-looking<br />with impeccable hair?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Hopeful.
How would I even<br />approach Namaari
after all that's happened?
It may feel impossible,<br />but sometimes,
you just have to take<br />the first step,
even before you're ready.
Trust me.
(SOFT SENTIMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
Okay. We'll go with your plan.
What? My plan?<br />You're gonna go with my plan?
-Yeah.<br />-(LAUGHS) All right!
You're not gonna regret this.
But we're gonna need<br />a really good gift.
What do you think she's into?<br />Cats? Knives?
-Cats with knives?<br />-(LAUGHS)
SISU: Knives with little cats<br />on them?
Actually, I know exactly what<br />to give her.
