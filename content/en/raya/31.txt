All right, everyone,<br />here's the plan.
The last gem piece is in Fang,
the most heavily guarded<br />of the five lands.
Now, they're protected<br />by an artificial canal
that separates them<br />from the rest of the world.
The only way in or out
is by water.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXCLAIMING)
RAYA: Luckily for us,<br />we have a magic water dragon.
Now, the palace will be<br />swarmingwith Fang soldiers.
To sneak past them,<br />we'll need to...
I got this, guys.
I'll take care<br />of the first wave.
(GRUNTING)
BOUN: Tong will follow up
with hisgiant axe<br />of bad-axery.
(TONG EXCLAIMING)
BOUN: And then come the ongis<br />and that crazy con-baby...
(CON-BABY EXCLAIMING)
BOUN: ...who will toss the gem<br />to the Mighty Sisudatu.
(BOUN MIMICKING SISU GROWLING)
And then, bye-bye, binturis.
(BOUN MIMICKING EXPLOSIONS)
-Super flow plan, am I right?<br />-(CON-BABY CLAPPING)
Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow.<br />That's a clog.
I agree.
Here's my plan.
We infiltrate Fang,
confront Namaari,
and offer her something nice<br />and go...
Hey! Wanna help us<br />save the world?
Because all it takes<br />is one gem piece.
(SISU SPEAKING AS NAMAARI)<br />Yes!
I've been waiting<br />for someone to ask me!
Here you go!
Best friends forever!
Yeah, I think I'd rather<br />go with Boun's plan.
What?
Yes!
What, why?
Because it's Fang.
Their blades<br />are specially designed
for the stabbing of backs.
If it weren't for them,
none of this<br />would have happened.
They're the worst.
(MUMBLES IN AGREEMENT)
If we're just honest with her,
deep down, I got a feeling
she wants to fix the world<br />as much as we do.
You weren't there<br />when Namaari betrayed me.
We're sticking with my plan.
(SISU GRUNTS ANNOYEDLY)
Whoa. Uh...<br />What's with the downpour?
SISU: Come on!<br />I need to show you something.
(RAYA EXCLAIMING FEARFULLY)
So, what do we do now?
I don't know.
