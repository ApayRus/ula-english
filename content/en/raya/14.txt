(CAT GROWLING)
Namaari.
What's drippin', dep la?
Oh, I see you've finally<br />made a new friend.
And here I was worried
you were gonna end up<br />becoming a cat lady
like me.
(GROWLS)
Something tells me<br />you're not besties.
Stealing Dragon Gem pieces,<br />are we? Why?
What can I say?<br />Bling is my thing.
Hmm.
I gotta admit, Raya,<br />until a few months ago,
I thought you were stone.
But then, someone stole<br />Fang's dragon scroll.
Oh, is that why<br />you're chasing me?
And here I thought<br />it was because you missed me.
Are you really looking<br />for Sisu?
(LAUGHING)
What are you, 12?
Yeah, I actually was looking<br />for Sisu.
Oh, and guess what?<br />I found her.
Say hi, Sisu.
Hi!
It's very nice to meet you,
and I love your hair<br />and your cats' hair.
(CHUCKLES)
Take them.
