BOUN: Raya! Raya!
The gem's magic,<br />it's almost gone!
TONG: They aren't backing off!
BOUN: They're everywhere!

SISU: I don't know why<br />they chose me.
It could have been any of us.
All I know is I trusted them,
and they trusted me.
And so...
Everyone, give me your gems.
We can still put it together.<br />It can still work.
Sisu's gone, Raya!<br />We don't have her magic!
It's not about her magic.<br />It's about trust.
What?
That's why it worked.<br />That's why we can do it, too.
By doing the one thing<br />Sisu wanted us to do.
What my ba wanted us to do.
To finally trust each other<br />and fix this.
But we have to come together.
Please.
After what she's done?
We'll never trust her!

Then let me take<br />the first step.
Raya! No!
