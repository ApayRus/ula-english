And that is how<br />the land of Fang rose
in spite of all the monsters<br />that wanted to destroy us.
Because we're smart, resilient,
and we take care of one another.
Mother! We need to talk.
It's Princess Namaari!
(CHILDREN EXCLAIMING)
All right, all right,<br />now, run along, kittens.
-(CHILDREN MUMBLING DISAPPOINTEDLY)<br />-I have to speak with the princess.
Mother, you won't believe what I saw.
You saw a dragon.
General AtitƒÅya informed me
that you'd be returning home<br />without the gem pieces.
It was Sisu.
She can fix what we broke.
She can bring everyone back.
And that's what scares me.
When everyone comes back,
who do you think<br />they'll come for?
You forget.
The other lands blame us<br />for what's happened.
But we... We never meant<br />for anyone to get hurt.
Yes, but if we had the dragon
and the gem pieces,
we would be forgiven.
We could save the world.
But more importantly,<br />our people would remain safe.
But Raya isn't just gonna<br />give Sisu to us.
(SIGHS)
We're not going to give her<br />a choice.
What are you going to do?
That's no longer<br />your concern, my love.
You've done enough.
