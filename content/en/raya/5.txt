(WHISPERS) Things look<br />a little tense, Ba.
(WHISPERS) Don't worry,<br />I'm gonna open with a joke.
Please don't.
(LAUGHING)<br />I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
(IN NORMAL VOICE)<br />People of Tail, Talon,
Spine, and Fang,
welcome to Heart.
For far too long,<br />we have been enemies,
but today is a new day.
Today, we can be Kumandra<br />once more.
(CLAPPING)
(SARCASTICALLY)<br />Nice speech, Chief Benja.
But why'd you really<br />bring us here?
Are you gonna rob us?
Why would he need to rob us?
The land of Heart<br />already has everything.
Oh, it's easy to pontificate<br />on Kumandra
when you hold the mightiest<br />weapon in all the lands.
(CROWD MUTTERING)
BENJA: The gem's not a weapon.<br />It's a sacred relic.
SPINE CHIEF: Kumandra!<br />Kumandra's a joke!
TAIL CHIEF:<br />He brought us all this way
to talk about fairy tales.
SPINE CHIEF:<br />This is pointless!
(CROWD CONTINUES CHATTERING<br />INDISTINCTLY)
I have something to say.
Who's hungry?
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh.
(CHUCKLES)
Go ahead. It's all right.
I'm Namaari, of Fang.
Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya.
(GASPS)
Is that Sisu?
Sorry, um, yeah,
I might be a little bit<br />of a dragon nerd.
Hey, I'm the one wearing<br />the Sisu fan necklace.
Come on.
Have you eaten yet?
