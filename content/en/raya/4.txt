MAN: Whoa. Ah...
(BENJA LAUGHING)
Well, someone's excited.
YOUNG RAYA: Well, yeah!
I mean, anyone hoping<br />to steal the Dragon Gem
now has to face the fury
of the two baddest blades<br />in all the lands.
(LAUGHING) I'm glad<br />you feel prepared, dewdrop,
because I have something<br />important to tell you.
The other lands, they're on<br />their way here, as we speak.
-They are? Uh...<br />-(TUK TUK SQUEAKS)
Okay.
Okay, no, we can do this.<br />I'm ready.
I know exactly<br />how we'll stop them.
Really? Tell me what you know<br />about the other lands.
First... Tail.
A sweltering desert<br />with sneaky mercenaries
who fight dirty.
Second, Talon.
A floating market famous<br />for fast deals
and fighters<br />with even faster hands.
Third, Spine.
A frigid bamboo forest
guarded by<br />exceptionally large warriors,
and their giant axes.
(EXCLAIMS)
YOUNG RAYA: Fourth, Fang.<br />Our fiercest enemy.
A nation protected<br />by angry assassins,
and their even angrier cats.
-(HISSING)<br />-(TUK TUK EXCLAIMS)
Okay,
so we're gonna need some<br />crossbows and catapults and...
Ooh! What about<br />flaming catapults?
Or, how about<br />shrimp paste from Tail.
lemongrass from Talon,<br />bamboo shoots from Spine,
chilis from Fang<br />and palm sugar from Heart?
We'll poison them?
(LAUGHING) No, we're not going<br />to poison them
and we're not going<br />to fight them.
We're going to share a meal<br />with them.
-Wait, what?<br />-I invited them.
But they're our enemies.
They're only our enemies
because they think<br />the Dragon Gem
magically brings<br />us prosperity.
That's ridiculous.<br />It doesn't do that.
They assume it does,
just like we assume things<br />about them.
Raya, there's a reason why<br />each land
is named after<br />a part of the dragon.
We were once unified.<br />Harmoniously as one.
Kumandra.
That's ancient history, Ba.
But it doesn't have to be.
Listen, if we don't stop
and learn to trust<br />one another again,
it's only a matter of time
before we tear<br />each other apart.
This isn't the world<br />I want you to live in.
I believe that<br />we can be Kumandra again.
But someone has to take<br />the first step.
(SIGHS)
Trust me.
