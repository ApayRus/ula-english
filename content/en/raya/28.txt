Sisu! Come back! Please!
What... What are you doing?
SISU: I'm going to show you<br />that you're wrong!
How? By getting squashed by<br />a bunch of Spine rage-heads?
No.
By proving to you
that if you wanna get<br />someone's trust,
you have to give<br />a little trust first.
-Wait, Sisu, don't...<br />-(KNOCKER CLANGS)
(BOTH EXCLAIM)
SISU: In hindsight,<br />maybe I was a little hasty,
but, uh, who's hungry?
No? I'll leave you alone.
(RAYA GRUNTING)
Okay, where are we?
(FIRE CRACKLING)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Interesting choice of digs.
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)<br />-(BOTH GASP)
(DOOR CRASHES OPEN)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
You two must be<br />dung of brain
to think you could steal<br />Spine's Dragon Gem.
(CLANGS)
Gem? (SCOFFS)
Who said anything about gems?
We have no interest in gems.
(GEMS CLATTERING)
Okay, yeah, I can see how
that makes me look<br />like a liar.
Actually, I think<br />it was the lying
that made you look<br />like a liar.
(LAUGHING VILLAINOUSLY)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I'm not sure what's funny.
Your fear<br />is like delectable nectar
feeding the tum-tum<br />of my soul.
It's good.
Tastes like... (SNIFFS) mango.
Oh. I love mango.
Of course you love mango!
Only a tongue-less<br />cretin wouldn't.
Oh, toi!
It's been such a long time
since I've last peered
into the eyes<br />of a trembling enemy.
Where has the time gone?
It's been so long.
(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
He seems lonely.
No! I'm not lonely.
-I'm a Spine warrior.<br />-(THUMPS CHEST)
I was born and bred to do<br />only one thing.
To invoke fear
and to crush the skulls<br />of my enemies!
That's actually two things.
-(GROWLS AGGRESSIVELY)<br />-(SISU EXCLAIMING)
(LAUGHING)
Look at your face. (LAUGHING)
Hey. What do you plan on doing<br />with us?
Oh, it's gonna be bad.
Horrifying!
It'll take me two weeks<br />to clean up!
You have no idea, do you?
Yes, I do.
I'm formulating this<br />gruesome plan in my head...
Makes me sick<br />just thinking about it.
You... You just wait.
Until then, why don't you<br />just hang around?
Good one, huh?
(LAUGHING)
-(TUK TUK EXCLAIMING)<br />-(TONG GRUNTS)
(CON-BABY EXCLAIMS)
(ONGIS CHITTERING)
(TONG GRUNTS)
(TUK TUK GROWLING)
Huh?
(SNARLING IN BABY VOICE)
A little one?
All right!
Phew! Good work, Captain Boun!
-Fang's here!<br />-What?
NAMAARI: People of Spine,<br />we are hunting for Raya,
a fugitive from Heart!
Send her out,<br />or we're coming in!
You're the only one here?
My people battled the Druun<br />with much valor,
but lost.
Okay.
But the Fang gang's here<br />for me, not for you,
so, um,<br />if I can distract them,
then you guys<br />can get out of here.
You're gonna fight<br />an entire army?
No, I'm just gonna stall them.
Look, I know how to push<br />Namaari's buttons.
And once you guys are clear,<br />I'm out of there.
(SIGHS)
What's your name?
The moniker given to me<br />is Tong.
Okay, Tong, look,<br />you don't know me,
and I don't know you,
but I'm sure that<br />you know a back door
or a way outta here,
and it's really important that<br />my friends stay safe, okay?
So, I am sincerely asking you,<br />will you help us?
Please.
(GRUNTS IN AGREEMENT)
