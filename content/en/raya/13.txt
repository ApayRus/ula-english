RAYA:<br />Okay, so here's the sitch.
After the gem broke,<br />each piece was taken
by one of the chiefs<br />of the five lands,
Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon,<br />and Tail.
Where we are now.
SISU: Wow. So many questions.
First one,<br />why am I wearing this?
Well, we don't want<br />to attract attention.
Oh, you definitely chose<br />the right hat for that.
So, what makes you think<br />the Tail chief's here?
(GASPS)
-(EXCLAIMS)<br />-(CRASHES)
Because this place<br />didn't just booby-trap itself.
SISU: This doesn't make sense.
None of this<br />would stop a Druun.
RAYA: It's not to stop Druun.<br />It's to stop people.
SISU: Hmm.
-(SOFT THUD)<br />-(GRUNTING)
What?
Why are you looking at me<br />like that?
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)<br />Nothing.
I'm just not used to<br />seeing dragons.
Impressed, huh? Wait until<br />you see my backstroke.
I'm wicked<br />when I hit that liquid.
I got water skills that kill.
I slaughter<br />when I hit the water.
I'm, like, really good<br />at swimming, through rhyme.
I was trying to make that...
That I'm really good<br />at swim...
I'm a good swimmer,<br />is basically what I'm...
Okay, um,<br />we need to keep going.
-(GASPS) Oh, no!<br />-What? What is it?
We forgot to bring a gift<br />for the Tail chief.
I'm sorry. A gift?
Yeah. A gift says,
"You can trust me,<br />can I trust you?"
(GASPS)
Aw. Hey there,<br />little fella.
(LAUGHS)
This beetle's got a booty.
Uh... Careful.<br />It's a Toot N Boom.
-Why is it called a...<br />-(TOOTS)
-(EXPLODES)<br />-(BOTH GRUNT)
Got it. Noted. Makes sense.<br />(CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
RAYA: Uh...
You have to admit though,
these bug booties<br />are kind of cute.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES)
I'd say<br />we found the Tail chief.
SISU: What happened to her?
From the looks of it,
she was hoarding the gem
and became a victim<br />of her own traps.
Well, you gotta admire<br />her commitment.
(CLANGS)
Okay. Hold on.
(GRUNTS)
Oh, we were doing<br />a jumpy thing!
So sorry. My bad.
-(GRUNTING)<br />-I get it now. I'm with it.
(BOTH EXCLAIM)
(RAYA GRUNTS)
Sisu...
don't.
-(GRUNTS)<br />-(CRACKS)
(GASPS)
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXHALES IN RELIEF)
Two down, three to go.
(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)
(SISU EXCLAIMS)
I just shapechanged!<br />Into people!
Dragons can do that?
This was my sister<br />Pranee's thing.
Look at my people arms<br />and my people face.
Look how close my butt is<br />to my head.
Now that<br />you don't have to hide me,
getting the rest of the gems<br />is gonna be a breeze.
Yeah, well, this one was easy,
but the rest of them<br />are being held
by a bunch<br />of no-good binturis.
NAMAARI: Binturi?
That's not a very nice way<br />to describe an old friend.
