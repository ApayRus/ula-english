Like I said, not one foot<br />on the inner circle.
You lost, Raya.
Did I?
Raya...
I probably should have said<br />two feet.
Hey, don't beat yourself up<br />too much, Chief Benja.
You gave it your best.
(CHUCKLES) I won't.
And it's either "Father" or "Ba" to you.
You did good, dewdrop.<br />You passed the test.
-(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)<br />-(YOUNG RAYA GASPS)
Wow. (CHUCKLES)
The spirit of Sisu.
For generations, our family<br />has sworn to protect the gem.
Today, you will join<br />that legacy.
Raya, Princess of Heart,<br />my daughter,
you are now<br />a Guardian of the Dragon Gem.
