(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
(DRUUN SCREECHING)
(LOW GROWLING)
(TUK TUK WHIMPERS)
I know, buddy.
You know, during the day,
you can almost forget<br />they're here,
but at night...
(SCREECHING)
This is why<br />I never leave the boat.
You're a smart kid.
(SCREECHING CONTINUES<br />DISTANTLY)
What are Druun, anyways?
SISU: A plague.<br />Born from human discord.
They've always been here.
Waiting for a moment<br />of weakness to attack.
They're like<br />the opposite of dragons.
Instead of bringing water<br />and life to the world,
they're like a relentless fire
that consumes everything<br />in its wake
until there's nothing left<br />except ash and stone.
They took my family.
(SOFT SENTIMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
They took mine, too.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
(WATER RIPPLING GENTLY)
Looks like we're here.
So, where are you guys heading<br />after Talon?
I might be heading there, too.
I mean, for a fee, of course.
RAYA: (LAUGHS) Of course.
