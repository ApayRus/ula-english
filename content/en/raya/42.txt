We have a choice
To build or destroy
To fight or to come together
Love is a bridge
And trust is a gift
We give it<br />And it gets better
There's an energy<br />in the water
There is magic<br />deep in our heart
There's a legacy<br />that we honor
When we bring<br />the light to the dark
Whatever brings us together
Can never tear us apart
We become stronger than ever
When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way
When you're broken
Open up your heart and feel
There's no difference<br />We're all family here
Despite all of our doubts
All our up and downs
There's never really<br />anything to fear
There's an energy<br />in the water
There is magic<br />deep in our heart
There's a legacy<br />that we honor
When we bring the light<br />to the dark
Whatever brings us together
Can never tear us apart
We become stronger than ever
When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We'll lead the way
Takin' my first step
I see you as myself
Nothing we can't do
Put the past behind
Learn from life this time
We can start brand new
There's an energy<br />in the water
There is magic<br />deep in our heart
There's a legacy<br />that we honor
When we bring<br />the light to the dark
Whatever brings us together
Can never tear us apart
We become stronger than ever
When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We’ll lead the way<br />When we just trust
Trust and believe it<br />You'll see that
We'll lead the way
