SISU: Wow! What a smart way<br />to Druun-proof your house.
Build right on the water.
People of Talon are geniuses.
Yeah. Talon may look nice,
but it's a hotspot for<br />pickpockets and con artists.
Lucky for me. Empty pockets!
Okay, so here's the good news.
I know where the gem piece is.
The bad news?
It's being held by<br />the notorious Chief of Talon,
Dang Hai.
What Dang Hai lacks in style,<br />he makes up in mean.
(SMIRKS) Hmm.
SISU: Gotcha.
Now, we're just gonna have to<br />turn up the charm.
Let's go get him a gift.
Sisu, I think maybe<br />it's safer for you
to stay here on the boat.
What?
Without you, we can't<br />put the gem back together.
But I wanna help.
I know, and you will.
By staying safe.
I'll be back<br />before you know it.
If you see any hungry faces,<br />send 'em my way.
You got it, Captain.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(CHITTERS)
All right,<br />there's Dang Hai's house.
No detours<br />till we score that Dragon Gem.
(BABY CRYING)
Whoa. What in the...
Uh... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Okay.
-Hey, baby, toddler, thing...<br />-(COOING)
RAYA:<br />...whatever you're called.
It's really late.<br />What are you doing out here?
Where are your parents?
Hey, uh, whose baby...
-What? Ongis?<br />-(CHITTERS)
Drop 'em!
(CHITTERING)
-(EXCLAIMS)<br />-RAYA: Ow! (GRUNTS PAINFULLY)
-(EXCLAIMING)<br />-(GIGGLING)
Really? A con-baby?
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)
