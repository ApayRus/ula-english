(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
Did you just hit me<br />with a shrimp tail?
When were you gonna tell us<br />she was Sisu?
Well, technically,<br />you always knew she was Sisu.
Seriously?
Why are you here,
divine water dragon?
Isn't that obvious, big guy?
My girl Raya and I<br />are gonna fix the world.
Bring everyone back.
You're gonna<br />bring everyone back?
I wanna help.
(SIGHS) I'm sorry,<br />I can't let you do that.
It's too dangerous.
You're not the only one<br />who lost family to the Druun.
(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Please.
Let me help you.
(CON-BABY MUMBLING)

I too wish to join<br />this fellowship
of Druun butt-kickery!
