Those folks were,<br />like, crazy mad.
I just wanted<br />to bring some gifts
to the Talon chief Dang Hai.
Is that who<br />you're looking for, dear?
(GASPS EXCITEDLY)<br />I know exactly where he is.
You do?
Mm-hmm. I will take you there.
See? That's what I've been<br />trying to tell my girl Raya.
And she's all like,<br />"You can't trust people."
"Don't talk to anyone."
"I only eat terrible foods<br />I dried myself."
(LAUGHS) Come, dear.
Chief Dang Hai<br />is just outside the city,
beyond the gates.
SISU: Away from<br />the water, huh? Wow.
He really likes living<br />on the edge.
Hi there, Dang Hai.
Um, I'm Sisu,
and I've come here<br />to offer you some...
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)
Uh...
-(LOUD RUMBLING)<br />-(DRUUN SCREECHING)
Now, you're gonna tell me
where I can find<br />those other Dragon Gem pieces,
or I'll have to leave you<br />outside with that thing.
Take your pick.
But I... I trusted you.
Big mistake.
You better talk fast.
-It looks hungry.<br />-(DRUUN SCREECHING)
SISU: No. No, no. No, no, no!
Raya!
DANG HU: Stop her!
RAYA: Sisu, I told you<br />to stay on the boat.
SISU: Sorry!
Hold on to this for me,<br />will ya?
-(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)<br />-(FOG HISSING)
(EXCLAIMING)
RAYA: Fog?
SISU: Yeah. That was<br />my brother Jagan's magic.
RAYA: Okay.<br />Three down, two to go.
