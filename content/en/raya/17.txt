(IN HUSHED TONE) Sisu? Sisu?
SISU: (HAPPILY) Ah!
RAYA: Please get out of there.
I'm a water dragon.
This is water.<br />It's sort of my thing.
You wanna come in?
RAYA: Someone could see you.
Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop<br />and Lock over there?
What, are you scared
he's gonna challenge me<br />to a dance battle?
(RAYA GASPS)
(UTENSILS CLATTERING)
(LAUGHS)
(RAYA GRUNTS)
Sisu, I saw people<br />lose their minds
over a Dragon Gem.
Can you imagine what they'd do<br />over an actual dragon?
Look, we need you<br />to make this all work.
Until we have all the gems,<br />you have to stay human.
Please.
Wow, you really<br />got some trust issues.
Look, my father<br />blindly trusted people,
and now, he's stone.
Hey, we'll get your ba back.
I got you, girl.<br />Come on, who's your dragon?
I mean, human. Because<br />I'm gonna be a human until...
Yeah, you... You get it.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(BOUN GRUNTS)
Okay, who's hungry?
SISU: Oh, I am.
Two house specials.<br />How spicy would you like it?
Hot, hotter,<br />or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?
-Bring on the heat!<br />-Yeah, no.
No, I don't think so.
Uh, what are you doing?
(WHISPERING) We don't<br />know him. It could be poison.
(IN HUSHED TONE)<br />Why would he poison us?
Yeah, why would I poison you?
(IN NORMAL VOICE)<br />First, to get my jade purse,
second, to steal my sword,
and third, I don't know,<br />to kidnap my Tuk Tuk.
(TUK TUK STARTS)
All good points,<br />but if this is poison...
(SLURPING)
Mmm!
...you're gonna die happy.
Yeah, thanks,<br />but we got our own eats.
(GRUNTS)
(SLURPING)
This is delicious.
By the way, not poison.
But it's...
(GASPING)
It's hot. Ooh, it's hot!
-It's hot! It's really hot!<br />-(RAYA LAUGHING)
Oh, my! Oh! Water!
Boun? Captain Boun?<br />We need water on deck!
