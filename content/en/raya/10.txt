Six years of searching
and we end up<br />at a literal shipwreck.
(SIGHS)
That's not a bad sign, is it?

Sisudatu...
Um...
I don't know<br />if you're listening.
I've searched every river<br />to find you,
and now I'm here<br />at the very last one.
Look, there's not<br />a lot of us left,
and we really...<br />We really need your help.
If I can be honest,
I really need your help.
I made a mistake.
I trusted someone<br />I shouldn't have, and...
(SIGHS)
...now the world's broken.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Sisudatu...
(CRIES SOFTLY)
I just really, really<br />want my ba back.
(CRIES)
Please.
(EXHALES)
Okay...
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Here goes everything.
