RAYA:<br />I know what you're thinking.
A lone rider.
A dystopian world.
A land that's gone to waste.
How did this world<br />get so broken?
Well, that all began<br />500 years ago.
Kumandra.
(TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING)
This is what we used to be.
When our land was whole,
and we lived harmoniously alongside...
dragons.
Magical creatures<br />who brought us
waterand rain and peace.
It was paradise.
But then, the Druun came.
(RUMBLING)
A mindless plague<br />that spread like wildfire,
multiplying<br />as they consumed life
and turned everyone they touched into stone.
The dragons fought for us<br />the best they could,
but it wasn't enough.
That's when<br />the Mighty Sisudatu,
the last dragon,
concentrated all her magic<br />into a gem and...
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC RISING)
...blasted the Druun away.
Everyone that was turned<br />to stone came back.
Except the dragons.
All that was left of Sisu was her gem.
It should have been this big inspirational moment,
where humanity united over her sacrifice.
But instead,<br />people being people,
they all fought to possess
the last remnant<br />of dragon magic.
Borders were drawn,<br />Kumandra divided.
We all became enemies,<br />and the gem had to be hidden.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
But that's not how<br />the world broke.
That didn't truly happen<br />until 500 years later,
when I came into the story.
