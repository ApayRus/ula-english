(SCREECHING)
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
GENERAL ATITAYA: Chief Virana,<br />we're running out of room.
We need to expand<br />to the mainland.
VIRANA: And how do you propose<br />we handle the Druun,
General Atitāya?
Without proper protection,
it would be a death sentence<br />for our people.
I might have a solution<br />for that, Mother.
(GASPS SOFTLY)<br />My little morning mist...
Oh, it's good to see you home.
I located Raya.<br />She's out stealing gem pieces.
What?
I'd like to take<br />the royal army
and intercept her in Spine.
(SCOFFS) Well,<br />if she's going into Spine,
I doubt there'll be much left<br />of her to intercept.
She's more capable<br />than you realize.
We have to stop her.
(VIRANA SIGHS)
Walk with me.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Look around.
We made all this<br />by making smart decisions,
not emotional ones.
We are safe.
Our canal protects us<br />from those monsters.
I don't think it's wise<br />to risk yourself
when you don't have to.
But you heard the general.
We're running out of space.<br />We need to expand.
If we had all the gem pieces,<br />we could do that safely.
You're right.
This isn't<br />an emotional decision.
It's the only decision<br />we can make
to secure Fang's future.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Namaari, you're truly growing
into the leader<br />I raised you to be.
General Atitāya,<br />ready the royal army
-for my daughter's command.<br />-(THUMPS)
Thank you, Mother.<br />I won't let you down.
