(SOFT UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
YOUNG RAYA:<br />(LAUGHING) Seriously?
Your mom actually said that?
Awkward.<br />Okay, next question.
Hand-to-hand or swords?
-Blades all day. (CHUCKLES)<br />-Right?
Okay, dressy or casual?
Only a monster would choose
to wear this outfit<br />on the regular.
(LAUGHING)
YOUNG RAYA: Uh, rice or stew?
I didn't think<br />that'd stump you.
Uh... This is actually<br />one of the first times
I've had rice in awhile.
Really?
Fang may look nice<br />on the outside,
but we have some pretty<br />big holes on the inside.
Oh.
Sorry. Didn't mean<br />to bring it down.
So, where were we?
We both have single parents
who are terrible<br />at telling jokes.
We're both warrior women
who despise uncomfortable<br />formal wear.
And we're both Sisu superfans.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
You know, Fang legend says<br />she's still out there.
Sisu? You're kidding, right?
Wanna see something?
(GASPS AND WHISPERS)<br />Are you supposed to have that?
(SCOFFS) No.
According to this,
after the Mighty Sisu<br />blasted away all the Druun,
she fell into the water<br />and floated downstream.
Legends say she's now sleeping<br />at the river's end.
But which river?<br />There's, like, hundreds.
I don't know.
But if we could find it,<br />could you imagine?
A dragon back in the world.
Things could be<br />so much better.
YOUNG RAYA: Yeah.
Maybe we really could be<br />Kumandra again.
Here.
Whoa.
Really?
From one dragon nerd to another.
(SOFT SENTIMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
Hmm.
Hey.
Come with me, dep la.<br />I wanna show you something.
