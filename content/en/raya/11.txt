Oh, my... Where am I?
Pengu? Amba? Pranee?<br />Are you here?
Oh, Mighty Sisu.
Who said that?
-(WHOOSHES)<br />-(RAYA EXCLAIMS)
Hello?
Hello?
-(MUFFLED GROANING)<br />-SISU: Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.<br />I didn't see you there. (LAUGHS)
Not too bad.<br />Just a little dusty.
Let me get that for ya.<br />(LAUGHING)
RAYA: Sisu?
You are Sisu?
And you're people.
What's your name?
Raya. I'm Raya.
And you're not made of stone,<br />which means...
(EXCITEDLY) It worked!
We did it!
You hear that, Pengu?<br />It worked!
I didn't mess it up!
-Is that food?<br />-(RAYA GRUNTS)
I was so focused<br />on saving the world,
I forgot to have<br />breakfast today.
Today?
When exactly<br />do you think today is?
Tuesday.
(GURGLING)
I mean...<br />(FAKE EXCLAIMING) Mmm.
What is this delightful<br />culinary treat?
It's jackfruit jerky.<br />I dried it myself.
Well, compliments to the chef.<br />(LAUGHING)
Wanna finish this, Skippy?
(TUK TUK GRUMBLES)
RAYA: Uh...
Sisu, there are a few things<br />I need to catch you up on.
Oh, yeah?
(SHOUTING) You broke it?
(TUK TUK WHINES)
Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad.<br />This is bad.
I've been asleep<br />for 500 years,
you brought back<br />the Druun,
and none of my brothers<br />and sisters came back.
Why didn't they come back?
I don't know.
Also, you broke the gem!
But I still have<br />a big chunk of it, though.
Is that supposed<br />to make me feel better?
If you lost a puppy,<br />and I said...
(MOCKINGLY) "Well, we still<br />have a big chunk of it!"
Would that make you<br />feel better?
Can't you just make<br />another one?
No, I can't just<br />"make another one."
But you're a dragon.
I'm gonna be real<br />with you, all right?
I'm not, like,<br />the best dragon, ya know?
But you saved the world.
I did do that. That's true.
But have you ever done<br />like a group project,
but there's, like,<br />that one kid
who didn't pitch in as much,
but still ended up<br />with the same grade?
Yeah, I wasn't the one<br />who actually made the gem.
I just turned it in.
(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)
Whoa. Uh...
You're glowing.
Oh, thank you.
I use aloe and river slime<br />to maintain my...
RAYA: No, no. Look!
Oh! This is my little sister<br />Amba's magic.
I got the glow!
Your little sister's magic?
Yeah, every dragon<br />has a unique magic.
Okay, what's yours?
I'm a really strong swimmer.
Wait, wait, wait,<br />you touched this gem piece
and it gave you powers.
You know what<br />this means, right?
I no longer need<br />a night light?
What? No!<br />You're still connected to the gem's magic,
and that means<br />you can still use it
to save the world.
If we can get<br />all the other gem pieces...
-I can reassemble it...<br />-...you can reassemble it...
BOTH: ...and boom<br />the Druun away!
And bring my ba back?
And bring<br />all of Kumandra back.
