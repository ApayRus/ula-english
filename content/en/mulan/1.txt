We're under attack! Light the signal!
Light the fire now! Light the signal!
Now all of China knows you're here.
Perfect.
Your Majesty, the Huns have<br />crossed our northern border.
Impossible.<br />No one can get through the Great Wall.
Shan-Yu is leading them.
We'll set up defenses<br />around your palace immediately.
No. Send your troops<br />to protect my people. Chi Fu.
Yes, Your Highness?
Deliver conscription notices<br />throughout all the provinces.
Call up reserves<br />and as many new recruits as possible.
Forgive me, Your Majesty,<br />but I believe my troops can stop him.
I won't take any chances, General.
A single grain of rice can tip the scale.
One man may be the difference<br />between victory and defeat.
