You think your troops<br />are ready to fight?
They would not last<br />a minute against the Huns!
-They completed their training.<br />-Those boys
are no more fit to be soldiers<br />than you are to be Captain.
Once the General reads my report,
your troops will never see battle.
No, you don't! I've worked too hard<br />to get Mulan into this war.
This guy's messin' with my plan.
We're not finished!
Be careful, Captain.<br />The general may be your father,
but I am the Emperor's counsel.
And by the way,<br />I got that job on my own.
You're dismissed.
I'll hold him and you punch.
Or not.
For what it's worth,<br />I think you're a great captain.
-I saw that.<br />-What?
You like him, don't you?
No!
Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.<br />Go to your tent!
I think it's time we took this war<br />into our own hands.
Let me see what you got.
"From General Li. Dear son,<br />we're waiting for Huns at the pass.
"It would mean a lot<br />if you'd come and back us up."
That's great, except you forgot,<br />"And since we're out of potpourri,
"perhaps you wouldn't mind<br />bringing up some."
Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent!<br />Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's better. Much better. Let's go.
Khanny, baby. We need a ride.
Insubordinate ruffians!
You men owe me a new pair of slippers!
And I do not squeal like a girl.
Urgent news from the General.
What's the matter? You've never<br />seen a black and white before?
Who are you?
Excuse me?<br />I think the question is, who are you?
We're in a war, man!<br />There's no time for stupid questions!
I should have your hat for that.<br />Snatch it right off your head.
But I'm feeling gracious today,<br />so carry on before I report you.
Captain, urgent news from the General!<br />We're needed at the front.
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.<br />We're movin' out.
