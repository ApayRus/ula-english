<i>For a long time<br /></i>we've <i>been marching off to battle</i>
<i>In our thundering herd<br />we feel a lot like cattle</i>
<i>Like a pounding beat<br />our aching feet</i>
<i>Aren't easy to ignore</i>
<i>Think of instead</i>
<i>A girl worth fighting for</i>
That's what I said.
<i>A girl worth fighting for</i>
<i>I want her paler than the moon</i>
<i>With eyes that shine like stars</i>
<i>My girl will marvel at my strength</i>
<i>Adore my battle scars</i>
<i>I couldn't care less what she'll wear<br />or what she looks like</i>
<i>It all depends on what she cooks like</i>
<i>Beef, pork, chicken</i>
<i>Bet the local girls<br />thought you were quite the charmer</i>
<i>And I'll bet the ladies<br />love a man in armor</i>
<i>You can guess what<br />we have missed the most</i>
<i>Since we went off to war</i>
<i>-What do we want?</i><br /><i>-A girl worth fighting for</i>
<i>My girl will think I have no faults</i>
<i>That I'm a major find</i>
<i>How 'bout a girl who's got a brain</i>
<i>Who always speaks her mind?</i>
<i>My manly ways and turn of phrase</i>
<i>Are sure to thrill her</i>
<i>He thinks he's such a lady killer</i>
<i>I've a girl back home<br />who's unlike any other</i>
<i>Yeah, the only girl<br />who'd love him is his mother</i>
<i>But when we come home in victory</i>
<i>They'll line up at the door</i>
<i>-What do we want?</i><br /><i>-A girl worth fighting for</i>
<i>-Wish that I had<br />-A girl worth fighting for</i>
<i>A girl worth fighting...</i>
