Make way for the heroes of China.
-Shang!<br />-Mulan?
The Huns are alive! They're in the city!
You don't belong here, Mulan.<br />Go home.
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.<br />You have to believe me.
Why should I?
Why else would I come back?
You said you'd trust Ping.<br />Why is Mulan any different?
Keep your eyes open.<br />I know they're here.
Now, where are you going?
To find someone who will believe me.
My children, heaven smiles down
upon the Middle Kingdom.
China will sleep safely tonight.
Thanks to our brave warriors.
Sir, the Emperor's in danger.
But the Huns are here.
Please, you have to help.
-No one will listen.<br />-I'm sorry. Did you say something?
-Mushu.<br />-You're a girl again, remember?
Your Majesty, I present to you<br />the sword of Shan-Yu.
I know what this means<br />to you, Captain Li.
Your father would have been<br />very proud.
