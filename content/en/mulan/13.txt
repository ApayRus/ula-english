What do you see?
Black pine, from the high mountains.
White horse hair. Imperial stallions.
Sulfur, from cannons.
This doll came from a village<br />in the Tung Shao Pass,
where the Imperial Army<br />is waiting for us.
We can avoid them easily.
No.
The quickest way<br />to the Emperor is through that pass.
And besides,<br />the little girl will be missing her doll.
We should return it to her.
