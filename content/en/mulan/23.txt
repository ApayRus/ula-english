You!
-You took away my victory!<br />-No!
I did.
The soldier from the mountains.
So what's the plan?
You don't have a plan?
I'm making this up as I go.
-Mushu!<br />-Way ahead of you, sister.
Come on, Cri-Kee.
-Citizens, I need firepower.<br />-Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
-On the roof!<br />-Look!
It looks like you're out of ideas.
Not quite.
Ready, Mushu?
I am ready, baby! Light me.
Get off the roof, get off the roof,<br />get off the roof.
You are a lucky bug.
