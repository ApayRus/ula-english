Okay, this is it.<br />Time to show 'em your man walk.
Shoulders back, chest high,<br />feet apart, head up and strut.
Two, three... Break it down.<br />Hup, two, three. And work it!
-Beautiful, isn't he?<br />-They're disgusting.
No, they're men.
Now, you gonna have to act<br />just like them, so pay attention.
Look. This tattoo will protect me<br />from harm.
I hope you can get your money back.
I don't think I can do this.
It's all attitude.<br />Be tough, like this guy here.
What are you lookin' at?
Punch him. It's how men say hello.
Yao, you've made a friend.
Good. Now slap him on the behind.<br />They like that.
I'm gonna hit you so hard,<br />it'll make your ancestors dizzy.
Yao, relax and chant with me.
Feel better?
Yeah. You ain't worth my time.
-Chicken boy.<br />-Chicken boy?
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!
Sorry, Ling.
You're dead!
There he goes!
Guys.
The Huns have struck here,<br />here and here.
I will take the main troops<br />up to the Tung Shao Pass,
and stop Shan-Yu<br />before he destroys this village.
Excellent strategy, sir.
I do love surprises.
You will stay and train the new recruits.
When Chi Fu believes you're ready,
you will join us, Captain.
Captain?
This is an enormous<br />responsibility, General.
Perhaps a soldier<br />with more experience.
Number one in his class, extensive<br />knowledge of training techniques,
and impressive military lineage.
I believe Li Shang will do<br />an excellent job.
I will. I won't let you down.<br />This is... I mean...
-Yes, sir.<br />-Very good, then.
We'll toast China's victory<br />at the Imperial City.
I'll expect a full report in three weeks.
And I won't leave anything out.
Captain Li Shang.
Leader of China's finest troops.
No. The greatest troops of all time.
Most impressive.
Good luck, Captain!
Good luck, Father.
Day one.
Soldiers!
He started it!
I don't need anyone<br />causing trouble in my camp.
Sorry.
I mean, sorry you had to see that.
But you know how it is<br />when you get those manly urges
and you just gotta kill somethin',
fix things, cook outdoors...
What's your name?
Your commanding officer<br />just asked you a question.
I've got a name.<br />And it's a boy's name, too.
-Ling. How 'bout Ling?<br />-His name is Ling.
I didn't ask for his name.<br />I asked for yours!
-Try, Chu.<br />-Chu.
-Chu?<br />-Gesundheit. I kill myself.
-Mushu.<br />-Mushu?
-No.<br />-Then what is it?
-Ping was my best friend growin' up.<br />-It's Ping.
-Ping?<br />-Of course, Ping did steal my...
Yes, my name is Ping.
Let me see your conscription notice.
-Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?<br />-I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
He doesn't talk about me much.
I can see why.<br />That boy's an absolute lunatic.
Okay, gentlemen,<br />thanks to your new friend, Ping,
you'll spend tonight<br />picking up every single grain of rice.
And tomorrow, the real work begins.
You know, we have to work<br />on your people skills.
