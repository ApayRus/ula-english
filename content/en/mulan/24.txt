That was a deliberate attempt<br />on my life!
Where is she? Now she's done it.
What a mess! Stand aside!
That creature's not worth protecting.

Your Majesty, I can explain.
I've heard a great deal<br />about you, Fa Mulan.
You stole your father's armor,<br />ran away from home,
impersonated a soldier,
deceived your commanding officer,
dishonored the Chinese army,<br />destroyed my palace
and
you have saved us all.
My little baby is all grown up<br />and savin' China.
You have a tissue?
Chi Fu?
Your Excellency?
See to it that this woman is made<br />a member of my council.
Member? What?
But... There are no<br />council positions open,
Your Majesty.

With all due respect, Your Excellency,
I think I've been away<br />from home long enough.

And this,
so the world will know<br />what you have done for China.
Is she allowed to do that?
You...
You fight good.
Thank you.
Khan, let's go home.
The flower that blooms in adversity
is the most rare and beautiful of all.
Sir?
You don't meet a girl like that<br />every dynasty.
