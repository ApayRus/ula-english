<i>Look at me</i>
<i>I will never pass</i>
<i>For a perfect bride</i>
<i>Or a perfect daughter</i>
<i>Can it be</i>
<i>I'm not meant to play this part?</i>
<i>Now I see</i>
<i>That if I were truly to be myself</i>
<i>I would break my family's heart</i>
<i>Who is that girl I see</i>
<i>Staring straight</i>
<i>Back at me?</i>
<i>Why is my reflection</i>
<i>Someone I don't know?</i>
<i>Somehow I cannot hide</i>
<i>Who I am</i>
<i>Though I've tried</i>
<i>When will my reflection show</i>
<i>Who I am inside?</i>
<i>When will my reflection show</i>
<i>Who I am</i>
<i>Inside?</i>
My, my.
What beautiful blossoms<br />we have this year.
But, look, this one's late.
But I'll  bet that when it blooms,
it will be the most beautiful of all.
What is it?
