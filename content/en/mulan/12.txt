All right! Rise and shine,<br />Sleeping Beauty.
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.
Get your clothes on.
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.
Look, you get porridge,<br />and it's happy to see you.
Get outta there!<br />You gonna make people sick.
-Am I late?<br />-No time to talk.
Now remember,<br />it's your first day of training,
so listen to your teacher and no fightin',<br />play nice with the other kids,
unless one of the other kids<br />wanna fight,
then you have to kick<br />the other kid's butt.
But I don't wanna kick<br />the other kid's butt.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Now let's see your war face.
I think my bunny slippers<br />just ran for cover.
Come on! Scare me, girl.
Yeah, that's my tough-lookin' warrior.
That's what I'm talkin' about.<br />Now, get out there and make me proud.
-What do you mean the troops just left?<br />-They what?
Wait! You forgot your sword.
My little baby, off to destroy people.
Order. People, order.
-I'd like a pan-fried noodle.<br />-Sweet and pungent shrimp.
-Moo goo gai pan.<br />-That's not funny.
Looks like our new friend<br />slept in this morning.
Hello, Ping. Are ya hungry?
Yeah, 'cause I owe you<br />a knuckle sandwich.
Soldiers!
You will assemble swiftly<br />and silently every morning.
Anyone who acts otherwise
will answer to me.
Tough guy.
Yao.
Thank you for volunteering.<br />Retrieve the arrow.
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,
and I'll do it with my shirt on.
One moment.<br />You seem to be missing something.
This represents discipline,
and this represents strength.
You need both to reach the arrow.
We've got a long way to go.
<i>Let's get down to business</i>
<i>To defeat the Huns</i>
<i>Did they send me daughters</i>
<i>When I asked for sons?</i>
<i>You're the saddest bunch I ever met</i>
<i>But you can bet before we're through</i>
<i>Mister, I'll make a man</i>
<i>Out of you</i>
<i>Tranquil as a forest</i>
<i>But on fire within</i>
<i>Once you find your center</i>
<i>You are sure to win</i>
<i>You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot</i>
<i>And you haven't got a clue</i>
<i>Somehow I'll make a man</i>
<i>Out of you</i>
<i>I'm never gonna catch my breath</i>
<i>Say goodbye to those who knew me</i>
<i>Boy, was I a fool<br />In school for cutting gym</i>
<i>This guy's got 'em scared to death</i>
<i>Hope he doesn't see right through me</i>
<i>Now I really wish<br />that I knew how to swim</i>
<i>-Be a man<br />-We must be swift as a coursing river</i>
<i>-Be a man</i><br /><i>-With all the force of a great typhoon</i>
<i>-Be a man</i><br /><i>-With all the strength of a raging fire</i>
<i>Mysterious as the dark side<br />of the moon</i>
<i>Time is racing toward us</i>
<i>Till the Huns arrive</i>
<i>Heed my every order</i>
<i>And you might survive</i>
<i>You're unsuited for the rage of war</i>
<i>So pack up, go home, you're through</i>
<i>How could I make a man</i>
<i>Out of you?</i>
<i>-Be a man<br />-We must be swift as a coursing river</i>
<i>-Be a man</i><br /><i>-With all the force of a great typhoon</i>
<i>-Be a man</i><br /><i>-With all the strength of a raging fire</i>
<i>Mysterious as the dark side</i>
<i>Of the moon</i>
