Too skinny.
Not good for bearing sons.
Recite the final admonition.
Well?
Fulfill your duties<br />calmly and respectfully.
Reflect before you snack...
Act! This shall bring you<br />honor and glory.
This way.
Now, pour the tea.
To please your future in-laws,
you must demonstrate<br />a sense of dignity
and refinement.
You must also be poised.
-Pardon me.<br />-And silent!
Could I just take that back?
One moment.
Why, you clumsy...
I think it's going well, don't you?
Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!
You are a disgrace!
You may look like a bride,
but you will never<br />bring your family honor!
