I was this close.
This close to impressin' the ancestors,
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.
Man. All my fine work.
Hi.
I should never have left home.
Come on.<br />You went to save your father's life.
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him<br />and disgracing your ancestors
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...<br />You gotta learn to let these things go.
Maybe I didn't go for my father.
Maybe what I really wanted was<br />to prove I could do things right,
so when I looked in the mirror,
I'd see someone worthwhile.
But I was wrong.
I see nothing.
Now, that's just 'cause<br />this needs a little spit, that's all.
Let me shine this up for ya.
I can see you.<br />Look at you. You look so pretty.
The truth is, we're both frauds.
Your ancestors never sent me.<br />They don't even like me.
I mean, you risked your life<br />to help people you love.
I risked your life to help myself.
At least you had good intentions.
What? What do you mean,<br />"Youâ€™re not lucky"?
You lied to me?
And what are you, a sheep?
I'll have to face my father<br />sooner or later.
Let's go home.
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.
But don't you worry, okay?<br />Things will work out.
We started this thing together,<br />and that's how we'll finish it.
I promise.
Home is that way.
-I have to do something.<br />-Did you see those Huns?
They popped out of the snow...<br />Like daisies!
Are we in this together or not?
Let's go kick some Hunny buns!
Yee-haw!
