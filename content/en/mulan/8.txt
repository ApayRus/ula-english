Mulan is gone!
What?
It can't be.
Mulan!
No.
You must go after her.<br />She could be killed.
If I reveal her,
she will be.
Ancestors, hear our prayer.
Watch over Mulan.
Mushu, awaken.
I live!
So tell me what mortal needs<br />my protection, great ancestor.
-You just say the word and I'm there.<br />-Mushu...
And let me say somethin'.
Anybody who's foolish enough<br />to threaten our family,
vengeance will be mine!
Mushu!
These are the family guardians.
-They...<br />-Protect the family.
And you, O demoted one?
I ring the gong.
That's right.<br />Now, wake up the ancestors.
One family reunion cornin' right up.
Okay, people, people, look alive.<br />Let's go. Come on. Get up.
Let's move it. Rise and shine.
Y'all way past the beauty sleep thing,<br />trust me.
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan was<br />a troublemaker from the start!
Don't look at me.<br />She gets it from your side of the family.
She's just trying to help her father.
But if she's discovered,<br />Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.
Dishonor will come to the family.<br />Traditional values will disintegrate.
Not to mention, they'll lose the farm.
My children never caused such trouble.<br />They all became acupuncturists.
-We can't all be acupuncturists.<br />-No!
Your great-granddaughter<br />had to be a cross-dresser!
Let a guardian bring her back.
Yes, awaken the most cunning.
No. The swiftest.
-No. Send the wisest.<br />-Silence!
We must send the most powerful of all.
Okay, okay, I get the drift. I'll go.
Y'all don't think I can do it.<br />Watch this here.
Jump back. I'm pretty hot, huh?
Don't make me have to singe nobody<br />to prove no point.
You had your chance<br />to protect the Fa family.
Your misguidance led<br />Fa Deng to disaster.
-Yeah, thanks a lot.<br />-And your point is?
The point is we will be sending<br />a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
What... What... I'm a real dragon!
You are not worthy of this spot.<br />Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.
So you'll get back to me<br />on the job thing?
Just one chance,<br />is that too much to ask?
I mean, it's not like it'd kill ya.
Yo, Rocky, wake up!<br />Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!
Come on, boy! Go get her! Go on!
Come on.
Hello?
Hello!
Hello!
Stony?
Stony? Man, they're gonna kill me.
Great Stone Dragon,
have you awakened?
Yes, I just woke up.
I'm... I'm the Great Stone Dragon.<br />Good morning.
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.
Did I mention that<br />I was the Great Stone Dragon?
Go! The fate of the Fa family
rests in your claws.
Don't even worry about it.<br />I will not lose face.
My elbow!
I know I twisted somethin'.
That's just great. Now what?
I'm doomed,
and all 'cause Miss Man decides<br />to take her little drag show on the road.
Go get her?<br />What's the matter with you?
After this Great Stone,<br />Humpty Dumpty mess,
I'd have to bring her home<br />with a medal to get back in the temple.
Wait a minute. That's it!
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be<br />begging me to come back to work.
That's the master plan.<br />You done it now, man.
What makes you think you're comin'?
You're lucky?
Do I look like a sucker to you?
What you mean, a loser?
How 'bout I pop one of your<br />antennas off, throw it across the yard?
Then who's the loser, me or you?
