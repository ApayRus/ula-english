What happened?
You just gave away our position!<br />Now we're...
Get out of range!
Save the cannons!
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!
Sure. Save the horse.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the last cannon.
Prepare to fight.<br />If we die, we die with honor.
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.
Ping! Come back!
Ping!
Stop!
All right. You might want<br />to light that right about now.
Quickly. Quickly!
Come on! We gotta help!
You missed! How could you miss?
It was three feet in front of you!
Mulan!
Mulan!
Mulan?
No.
Mulan!
Man, you are one lucky bug.
Shang!
-Do you see them?<br />-Yes.
Perfect. Now we'll pull them to safety.
Mulan! I found the lucky cricket!
We need help.
Nice. Very nice. You can sit by me.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!<br />We are definitely gonna die.
No way we survive this.<br />Death is coming!
I let them slip through my fingers.
Pull!
I knew we could do it. You the man!
Sort of.
Step back, guys. Give him some air.
Ping?
You are the craziest man I've ever met.
And for that, I owe you my life.
From now on, you have my trust.
Let's hear it for Ping!<br />The bravest of us all!
You're king of the mountain!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ping! What's wrong?
He's wounded! Get help!
Ping, hold on.
Hold on.
