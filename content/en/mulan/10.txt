Okay, okay, how about this?
Excuse me.
Where do I sign in?
I see you have a sword. I have one, too.
They're very manly and tough.
I'm working on it!
Who am I fooling?
It's going to take a miracle<br />to get me into the army.
Did I hear someone ask for a miracle?
Let me hear you say "Aaah"!
-That's close enough.<br />-A ghost.
Get ready, Mulan.<br />Your serpentine salvation is at hand!
For I have been sent by your ancestors
to guide you through your masquerade.
Come on. If you're gonna stay,<br />you're gonna work.
So heed my word! 'Cause if<br />the army finds out you're a girl,
the penalty is death!
-Who are you?<br />-Who am I? Who am I?
I am the guardian of lost souls.
I am the powerful, the pleasurable,
the indestructible Mushu.
Pretty hot, huh?
My ancestors sent<br />a little lizard to help me?
Dragon, dragon, not lizard.
I don't do that tongue thing.
You're...
Intimidating? Awe-inspiring?
-Tiny.<br />-Of course.
I'm travel size for your convenience.
If I was my real size,<br />your cow here would die of fright.
Down, Bessie. My powers are<br />beyond your mortal imagination.
For instance, my eyes can see<br />straight through your armor.
All right, that's it! Dishonor!<br />Dishonor on your whole family.
Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,<br />dishonor on your cow...
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.<br />I've never done this before.
Then you're gonna have to trust me.<br />And don't you slap me no more.
We clear on that? All right.
Okey-dokey.<br />Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.
Let's move it, Heifer.
