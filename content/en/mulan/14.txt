No, this is not a good idea.<br />What if somebody sees you?
Just because I look like a man<br />doesn't mean I have to smell like one.
So a couple of guys don't rinse out their<br />socks. Picky, picky, picky.
Myself, I kind of like that<br />corn chip smell.
Okay, all right. That's enough.
Get out before you get<br />all pruny and stuff.
Mushu, if you're so worried,<br />go stand watch.
Yeah, yeah. "Stand watch, Mushu,
"while I blow our secret<br />with my stupid girlie habits."
Hygiene!
Me first! Me first!
We're doomed!
There are a couple of things<br />I know they're bound to notice!
Ping!
Hi, guys. I didn't know you were here.
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,<br />and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.
Come back here.<br />I know we were jerks to you before,
so let's start over.
Hi. I'm Ling.
-And I'm Chien-Po.<br />-Hello, Chien-Po.
And I am Yao!
King of the rock!
And there's nothin'<br />you girls can do about it.
Yeah? I think Ping and I can take you.
I really don't wanna take him anywhere.

Come on. Don't be such a...
Ouch! Something bit me!
What a nasty flavor.
Snake!
Oh, snake! Snake!
Snake! Snake!
Some king of the rock.
Boy, that was close.
No. That was vile.
You owe me big.
I never want to see a naked man again.
Don't look at me.<br />I ain't bitin' no more butts.
