Little brother!
Little brother.
There you are.
Who's the smartest doggy in the world?<br />Come on, smart boy.
Can you help me with my chores today?
Honorable ancestors,
please help Mulan impress<br />the Matchmaker today.
Please.
Please help her.
Father, I brought your...
-Mulan.<br />-I brought a spare.
Mulan.
Remember, the doctor said<br />three cups of tea in the morning...
-Mulan.<br />-And three at night.
Mulan, you should already be in town.<br />We are counting on you...
To uphold the family honor.
Don't worry, Father.<br />I won't let you down.
-Wish me luck.<br />-Hurry!
I'm going to pray some more.
