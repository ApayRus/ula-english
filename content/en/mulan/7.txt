Mulan.
Stay inside.
Citizens, I bring a proclamation
from the Imperial City.
The Huns have invaded China.
By order of the Emperor,
one man from every family<br />must serve in the Imperial Army.
The Hsiao family.
The Yi family.
I will serve the Emperor<br />in my father's place.
-The Fa family.<br />-No!
I am ready to serve the Emperor.
-Father, you can't go.<br />-Mulan!
Please, sir, my father has already<br />fought bravely...
Silence!
You would do well<br />to teach your daughter
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Mulan, you dishonor me.
Report tomorrow<br />to the Wu Zhong camp.
Yes, sir.
The Chu family!
The Wen family!
The Chang family!
-You shouldn't have to go!<br />-Mulan...
There are plenty of young men<br />to fight for China.
It is an honor to protect my country<br />and my family.
So, you'll die for honor.
I will die doing what's right.
-But if you...<br />- I know my place!
It is time you learned yours.
