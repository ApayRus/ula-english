Thank you.
Never let them see that they get to you.
So...
things do get to you?
No, I mean, not anymore...
but I was small...
and emotionally unbalanced like you once.
Har-har.
No, it's true.
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...
and all I wanted to do...
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.
<i>So, my mom scraped together<br />enough money...</i>
<i>to buy me a brand-new uniform...</i>
<i>because, by God, I was gonna fit in.</i>
<i>Even if I was the only<br />predator in the troop.</i>
<i>The only fox.</i>
Okay, Nick.
<i>I was gonna be<br />part of a pack.</i>
Ready for initiation?
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.
<i>I was so proud.</i>
Okay.
Now, raise your right paw<br />and deliver the oath.
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.
Even though you're a fox?
What?
No. No! What did I do wrong, you guys?
No, please! Tell me!<br />What did I do wrong?
<i>What did I do?</i>
No...
If you thought we would ever<br />trust a fox...
without a muzzle...
you're even dumber than you look!
Cry baby.
Aw, is he gonna cry?
<i>I learned<br />two things that day.</i>
<i>One...</i>
I was never gonna let anyone<br />see that they got to me.
And two?
If the world's only gonna see a fox...
as shifty and untrustworthy...
there's no point in trying<br />to be anything else.
Nick, you are so much more than that.
Boy, look at that traffic down there.
How about we go out to Chuck<br />in Traffic Central.
Chuck, how are things looking<br />on the Jam Cams?
Nick, I'm glad you told me.
The Jam Cams.
- Seriously. It's okay.<br />- No, no, no.
There are traffic cameras everywhere!
All over the canopy!
Whatever happened to that jaguar...
The traffic cams would have caught it!
- Bingo!<br />- Ho-ho!
Pretty sneaky, slick!
However, if you didn't have<br />access to the system before...
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt<br />is gonna let you into it now.
No.
But I have a friend<br />at City Hall who might.
