Here you go.
One missing otter.
That's it?
Yikes! That is the smallest<br />case file I've ever seen.
Leads, none.<br />Witnesses, none.
And you're not<br />in the computer system yet...
so resources, none!
Oh, I hope you didn't stake<br />your career...
on cracking this one!
Okay.<br />Last known sighting.
Can I just borrow... Thank you.
Popsicle?
The murder weapon.
Get your Popsicle.
Yeah. Because that...<br />What does that mean?
It means...
I have a lead.
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...
and I'm here to ask you<br />some questions about a case.
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?
It wasn't me.
Hey, Carrots, you're going<br />to wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.
This is important, sir.
I think your $10 worth<br />of popsicles can wait.
I make<br />200 bucks a day, Fluff!
365 days a year, since I was 12.
And time is money. Hop along.
Please, just look at the picture.
You sold Mr. Otterton<br />that Popsicle, right?
Do you know him?
I know everybody.
And I also know that, somewhere...
there's a toy store missing<br />its stuffed animal...
so why don't you get back to your box?
Fine. Then we'll have<br />to do this the hard way.
Did you just boot my stroller?
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
Ha! For what?<br />Hurting your feelings?
Felony Tax Evasion.
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year...
since you were 12.
That's two decades, so times 20...
which is $ 1,460, 000, I think.
I mean,<br />I am just a dumb bunny...
but we are good at multiplying.
Anyway, according to your tax forms...
you reported, let me see here... zero!
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form...
is a punishable offense.
Five years jail time.
Well, it's my word against yours.
<i>200 bucks a day, Fluff!</i>
<i>365 days a year, since I was 12.</i>
Actually, it's your word against yours.
And if you want this pen,<br />you're going to help me...
find this poor, missing otter...
or the only place you'll be<br />selling popsicles...
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
She hustled you.
She hustled you good!
You a cop now, Nick.<br />You gonna need one of these.
Have fun...
working with the fuzz!
Start talking.
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.
Great. Let's go.
It's not exactly a place for, uh...
a cute little bunny.
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.
Okay. You're the boss.
