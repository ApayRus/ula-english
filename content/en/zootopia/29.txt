Who is it?
I need to find Nick.
Please.
Nick?
Nick!
Oh, Nick.
Night Howlers aren't wolves.
They're toxic flowers.
I think someone is targeting<br />predators on purpose...
and making them go savage!
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?
Wait... Wait! Listen...
I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either.<br />I was ignorant...
And irresponsible and small-minded.
But predators shouldn't suffer<br />because of my mistakes.
I have to fix this.
But I can't do it without you.
And after we're done...
you can hate me.
And... And that'll be fine.
Because I was a horrible friend...
and I hurt you...
and you can walk away knowing<br />that you were right all along.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
<i>I really am<br />just a dumb bunny.</i>
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>
Don't worry, Carrots.<br />I'll let you erase it...
in 48 hours.
All right. Get in here.
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.<br />You're so emotional.
There we go. Deep breath.
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?
You are standing on my tail,<br />though. Off, off, off, off...
Oh, I'm sorry.
