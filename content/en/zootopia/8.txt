Hey, watch where you're going, fox!
Mmm.
Where'd he go?
Listen, I don't know what<br />you're doing skulking...
around during daylight hours...
but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.
I'm not looking for<br />any trouble either, sir.
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...
for my little boy.
You want the red or the blue, pal?
Aw...
I'm such a...
Oh, come on, kid. Back up.
Listen, buddy. What?
There aren't any fox ice cream joints...
in your part of town?
Uh, no, no. There are.
There are. It's just, my boy,<br />this goofy little stinker...
he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.
Is that adorable?
Oh!
Who the heck am I to crush<br />his little dreams, huh? Right?
Look, you probably can't read, fox...
but the sign says...
"We reserve the right<br />to refuse service...
"...to anyone." So, beat it.
You're holding up the line.
Hello? Excuse me.
Hey, you're gonna have<br />to wait your turn...
like everyone else, meter maid.
Actually, I'm an officer.
Just had a quick question.
Are your customers aware...
they're getting snot and mucus...
with their cookies and cream?
What are you talking about?
Well, I don't want to cause you any trouble...
but I believe scooping ice cream...
with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3...
health code violation.
Which is kind of a big deal.
Of course, I could let you off<br />with a warning...
if you were to glove those<br />trunks and, I don't know...
finish selling this nice dad<br />and his son a...
What was it?
A Jumbo Pop. Please.
A Jumbo Pop.
$15.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?<br />I don't have my wallet.
I'd lose my head if it weren't<br />attached to my neck.
That's the truth.
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.
Keep the change.
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?
Oh, no, my treat. It just...
You know, it burns me up to see folks...
with such backward attitudes toward foxes.
I just wanna say you're a great dad and just a...
a real articulate fella.
Oh, well, that is high praise.
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.
Officer...
Hopps. Mister...
Wilde. Nick Wilde.
And you, little guy...
You want to be an elephant<br />when you grow up?
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.
Anyone can be anything.
Oh, boy, I tell him that all the time.
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.
Oh, look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.
All right, give her a little<br />bye-bye toot-toot.
Toot-toot!
Bye, now.
Goodbye!
