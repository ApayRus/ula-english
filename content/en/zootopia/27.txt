Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.
The mayor? Why?
It would seem you've arrived.
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?
Um...
They thought it would be better...
if a predator such as myself...
wasn't the first face that you see...
when you walk into the ZPD.
What?
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.
It's by the boiler.
Hopps!
Um, I don't understand.
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...
and right now they're just really scared.
You're a hero to them. They trust you.
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I...
want you to be<br />the public face of the ZPD.
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.
I came here to make<br />the world a better place...
but I think I broke it.
Don't give yourself<br />so much credit, Hopps.
The world has always been broken...
that's why we need good cops.
Like you.
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...
is supposed to serve and protect.
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.
Hopps...
Judy, you've worked<br />so hard to get here.
It's what you wanted<br />since you were a kid.
You can't quit.
Thank you for the opportunity.
