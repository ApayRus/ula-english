Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl.
I didn't start it!
Come on.
You are a clever bunny.
It looks like<br />this was a hospital.
You know, after you. You're the cop.
Hmm.
- Okay, all clear.<br />- Ugh.
Huh.
All this equipment is brand new.
Carrots.
Claw marks.
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.<br />I mean, what kind of...
Mr. Manchas.
It's him.
We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton.
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.<br />Your wife sent me to find you.
We're gonna get you out of here now.
Or not.
Guess he's in no rush<br />to get home to the missus.
11, 12, 13, 14...
Not including Manchas, it's 14.
Chief Bogo handed out<br />14 missing mammal files.
They're all here.
All the missing mammals are right here.
Enough! I don't<br />want excuses, Doctor!
I want answers.
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.
Really?
Because I got a dozen<br />and a half animals here...
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...
and you can't tell me why.
Now, I'd call that awfully far<br />from "doing everything ."
Sir...
it may be time to consider their biology.
What? What do you mean "biology?"
The only animals<br />going savage are predators.
We cannot keep it a secret.<br />We need to come forward.
Hmm. Great idea. Tell the public.
And how do you think they're...

who is a lion?
I'll be ruined!
Well,<br />what does Chief Bogo say?
Chief Bogo doesn't know.
And we are going to keep it that way.
Oh, no, no, no!
Someone's here.
Sir, you need to go, now!
Security! Sweep the area!
Great! We're dead. We're dead.
That's it. I'm dead,<br />you're dead. Everybody's dead!
Can you swim?
What? Can I swim?<br />Yes, I can swim. Why?
