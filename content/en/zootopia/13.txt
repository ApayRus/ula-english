Okay. You're gonna<br />have to be patient...
and wait in line<br />just like everyone else...
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?
I popped the weasel!
Hopps!
Abandoning your post.
Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents.
But, to be fair...
you did stop a master criminal...
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir...
but those aren't onions.
Those are a crocus varietal...
called <i>midnicampum holicithias.</i>
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.
Well, I grew up in a family...
where plant husbandry<br />was kind of a thing.
Shut your tiny mouth now!
Sir, I got the bad guy.
That's my job.
Your job is putting tickets...
on parked cars!
<i>Chief...</i>
<i>uh, Mrs. Otterton's here<br />to see you again.</i>
- Not now.<br /><i>- Okay, I just didn't know . .</i>
<i>If you'd want to take it this time.</i>
<i>She seems really upset.</i>
- Not now!<br />- Sir...
I don't want to be a meter maid...
I want to be a real cop.
Do you think the mayor asked<br />what I wanted...
when he assigned you to me?
But, sir, if...
Life isn't some cartoon musical...
where you sing a little song...
and your insipid dreams<br />magically come true.
So, let it go.
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time. Please.
I'm sorry, sir.
I tried to stop her.<br />She is super-slippery.
I gotta go sit down.
Ma'am, as I've told you,<br />we're doing everything we can.
My husband has been missing<br />for 10 days.
His name is Emmitt Otterton.
Yes, I know.
He's a florist.
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.
Ma'am, our detectives<br />are very busy.
Please.
There's got to be somebody<br />to find my Emmitt.
Mrs. Otterton...
I will find him.
Oh!
Thank you.
- Bless you.<br />- Oh!
Bless you, little bunny.
Oh.
Take this.
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...
to me and my babies, please.
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.
Of course. Oh, thank you both so much.
One second.
You're fired.
What? Why?
Insubordination!
Now. I'm going to open this door...
and you're going to tell that otter...
you're a former meter maid...
with delusions of grandeur...
who will not be taking the case!
I just heard Officer Hopps<br />is taking the case.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative...
is really starting to pay off.
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna<br />be so jazzed!
No, no, let's not tell<br />the Mayor just yet.
And I've sent it and it is<br />done, so I did do that.
All right. Well, I'd say<br />the case is in good hands.
Us little guys really need to<br />stick together, right?
Like glue.
Good one.
Just call me if you ever<br />need anything, okay?
You've always got a friend<br />at City Hall, Judy.
All right, bye-bye.
Thank you, ma'am.
I will give you 48 hours.
Yes!
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
Okay.
But, you strike out, you resign.
Oh! Uh...
Okay.
Deal!
Splendid.
Clawhauser will give you<br />the complete case file.
