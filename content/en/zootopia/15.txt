Om!
Hi.
Hello?
Om!
Um, hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hmm?
- Hello. My name is...<br />- Oh...
You know, I'm going to hit...
the pause button right there...
because we're all good<br />on Bunny Scout cookies.
Uh... no.
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...
Emmitt Otterton, right here...
who may have frequented<br />this establishment.
Hmm.
Yeah, old Emmitt.
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.
But, hey, you should talk<br />to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.
Oh, thank you so much.<br />I'd appreciate that...
more than you can imagine,<br />it would be such...
- Ohh! You are naked!<br />- Huh?
Oh, for sure, we're<br />a naturalist club.
Yeah. In Zootopia,<br />anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.
Nangi's just on the other side<br />of the Pleasure Pool.
Oh, boy.
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there is no<br />shame in calling it quits.
Yes, there is.
Boy, that's the spirit.
Yeah, some mammals say...
the naturalist life is weird...
but you know what I say is weird?
Clothes on animals!
- Here we go.<br />- Mmm...
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant...
so she'll totally remember everything.
Hey, Nangi.
These dudes have some questions...
about Emmitt the otter.
Who?
Uh... Emmitt Otterton?
Been coming to your<br />yoga class for like...
6 years?
I have no memory of this beaver.
He's an otter, actually.
He was here a couple<br />Wednesdays ago, remember?
No.
Yeah, he was wearing...
a green cable-knit sweater vest...
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
Oh, and a paisley tie,<br />sweet Windsor knot.
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
No.
Yeah, and we both walked<br />him out, and he got into...
this big old white car<br />with a silver trim.
Needed a tune-up. The third<br />cylinder wasn't firing.
- Remember that, Nangi?<br />- No.
Uh...<br />You didn't happen to catch...
the license plate number, did you?
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...
T-H-D...
- 0-3.<br />- 0-3. Wow.
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.
Told you Nangi has a mind<br />like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
