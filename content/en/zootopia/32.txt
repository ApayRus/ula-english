Hey, open up!
What are you doing?<br />You just trapped us in here.
We need to get this<br />evidence to the ZPD!
Okay. Great! Here it is. Got it!
- No. All of it!<br />- Wait, what?
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?
Hey, listen. It would take a miracle...
to get this rust-bucket going.
Well. Hallelujah.
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
Oh, it just got worse!
Mission accomplished.
Would it be premature for me...
to do a little victory toot-toot?
All right. One toot-toot.
Well, I can cross that<br />off the bucket list.
I may have to rescind<br />that victory toot-toot.
Maybe that's just hail.
Come here!
Back off! Oh!
Whoa!
Incoming!
Carrots!
Don't stop! Keep going!
No, no! Please stop!
Do not stop this car!
Whoa!
Oh!
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!
There's another train coming!
Trust me. Speed up!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Need some help?
Oh, no, no, no!<br />Too fast! Too fast!
Hold on!
Ahh!
I think this is our stop!
Okay, maybe some<br />of the evidence survived.
Oh!
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.
Yeah...
Oh, except for this.
- Ow.<br />- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through<br />the Natural History Museum!
