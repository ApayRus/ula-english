We're real<br />proud of you, Judy.
Yeah. Scared, too.
- Yes.<br />- Really, it's kind of...
a proud-scared combo.
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.<br />Such a big city.
Guys...
I've been working for this my whole life.
We know. And we're just...
a little excited for you, but terrified.
The only thing we have<br />to fear is fear itself.
And also bears.<br />We have bears to fear, too.
Say nothing of lions and wolves.
- Wolves?<br />- Weasels.
You play cribbage with a weasel.
Yeah. And he cheats<br />like there's no tomorrow.
You know what, pretty much...
all predators.<br />And Zootopia's full of them.
Oh, Stu.
And foxes are the worst.
Actually, your father does<br />have a point there.
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened<br />with Gideon Grey?
When I was nine.
Gideon Grey was a jerk<br />who happened to be a fox.
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.<br />But just in case...
we made you a little care...
- package to take with you.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
And I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.<br />- Yeah, that's safe...
- to have that. Okay.<br />- This is fox repellent.
The deterrent and the repellent...
- that's all she needs.<br />- Check this out!
Oh, for goodness sake.
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.
Oh, come on. When is there not<br />a need for a fox Taser?
Okay, look! I will take this,<br />to make you stop talking.
Terrific! Everyone wins!
<i>Arriving, Zootopia Express.</i>
Okay, gotta go! Bye!
Bye, Judy!
Bye, Judy!
Mmm.
I love you guys.
Love you, too.
Oh, cripes, here come<br />the waterworks.
Oh, Stu, pull it together.
Bye, everybody!
- Bye-bye, Judy!<br />- Bye, Judy!
I love you!
Bye! Bye!
Goodbye!
