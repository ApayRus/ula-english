Sir, if we could just review<br />these very important...
Sir...
I'm so sorry. Sir!
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.<br />Just take care of it.
Please. And clear<br />my afternoon. I'm going out.
No, no! But, sir,<br />you do have a meeting...
with Herds and Grazing.
Sir, if I could just...
Oh, mutton chops.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?
We need your help.
We just need to get into<br />the traffic cam database.
So fluffy!
Hey!
Sheep never let me get this close.
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!
It's like cotton candy.
Stop it!
Where to?
Uh, Rainforest District,<br />Vine and Tujunga.
There! Traffic<br />cams for the whole city.
Oh, this is so exciting,<br />actually!
I never get to do<br />anything this important.
But you're the Assistant Mayor<br />of Zootopia.
Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary.
I think Mayor Lionheart<br />just wanted the sheep vote.
But he did give me that nice mug.
- Oh.<br />- Hmm.
Feels good to be appreciated.
<i>Smell-wether!</i>
Ugh. That's a fun little name<br />he likes to use.
I called him Lion-fart once.
He did not care for that.<br />Let me tell you...
it was not a good day for me.
Yes, sir?
<i>I thought you were going<br />to cancel my afternoon!</i>
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...
<i>- While we're young...</i><br />- Oh...
<i>Smell-wether!</i>
You think when she goes<br />to sleep she counts herself?
Oh, shush. Okay, traffic cams.
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.
- Who are these guys?<br />- Ugh.
Timberwolves.<br />Look at these dumb-dumbs.
Bet you a nickel<br />one of them is gonna howl.
And there it is.
What is it with wolves<br />and the howling? It's like...
Howlers. Night Howlers.
That's what Manchas<br />was afraid of! Wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.
All we gotta do is find out<br />where they went.
Wait, where did they go?
You know, if I wanted<br />to avoid surveillance...
because I was doing<br />something illegal...
which I never have...
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.
Which would put them out...
right there.
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.
You know, I think you'd actually...
make a pretty good cop.
Ugh. How dare you.
Acacia Alley?
Ficus Underpass.
- South Canyon.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
They're heading out of town.
Where does that road go?
