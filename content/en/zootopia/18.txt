Oh...
What did you do that made...
Mr. Big so mad at you?
I, uh, I may have sold him<br />a very expensive wool rug...
that was made from the fur of a skunk...
...'s butt.
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.
Is that Mr. Big?
No.
What about him?
- Is that him?<br />- No!
That's got to be him.
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!
- Huh.<br />- Mr. Big, sir.
This is a simple...
Yeah. Here...
Mmm...
This is a simple misunderstanding.
Oh...
You come here, unannounced...
on the day my daughter<br />is to be married.
Well, actually, we were brought here...
against our will, so...
The point is, I did not know<br />that it was your car...
and I certainly did not know<br />about your daughter's wedding.
Meh.
I trusted you, Nicky.
I welcomed you into my home.
We broke bread together.
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.
And how did you repay my generosity?
With a rug made from the butt<br />of a skunk.
A skunk-butt rug.
You disrespected me.
You disrespected my Gram-mama...
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.
I told you never to show<br />your face here again...
but here you are...
snooping around with this...
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?
Sir. I am a...
Mime! She is a mime.
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.<br />- Ugh...
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car.
So intimidate me all you want.
I'm going to find out<br />what you did to that otter...
if it's the last thing I do.
Meh.
Then I have only one request.
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.
Whoa!
I didn't see nothing!<br />I'm not saying nothing!
And you never will.
- Please! No, no, no!<br />- Put me down!
If you're mad at me about<br />the rug, I've got more rugs!
Oh, Daddy! It's time for our dance!
Oh, what did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.
Ice 'em.
No, no, no!
Wait. Please!
She's the bunny<br />that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut.
This bunny?
Yeah! Hi!
Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.<br />- Oh.
Put 'em down.
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.
I will take your kindness<br />and pay it forward.
Smile.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hmm.
Otterton<br />is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.
He had something important<br />he wanted to discuss.
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.
But he never arrived.
Because he was attacked.
No. He attacked.
Otterton?
Otterton. He went crazy.
Ripped up the car, scared<br />my driver half to death...
and disappeared into the night.
But he's a sweet little otter.
Hmm. My child, we may be evolved, but deep down...
we are still animals.
