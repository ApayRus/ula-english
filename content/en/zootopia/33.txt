There it is!
Judy!
Judy!
Mayor Bellwether!
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting<br />predators with a serum.
That's what's making them go savage.
I'm so proud of you, Judy.<br />You did just a super job!
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know where to find us?
I'll go ahead and<br />I'll take that case now.
Uh, you know what?
I think Nick and I will just<br />take this to the ZPD.
Run.
Get them.
Ahh!
Carrots!
I got you!
Come here, come here.
Okay, now just relax.
Whoops... Blueberry?
Pass.
Come on out, Judy.
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.
I'm not gonna leave you<br />behind. That's not happening.
I can't walk.
Just... We'll think of something.
We're on<br />the same team, Judy.
Underestimated, underappreciated.
Aren't you sick of it?
Predators.<br />They may be strong and loud...
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.
Think of it.
90% of the population...
united against a common enemy.
We'll be unstoppable.
Huh?
Over there!
Help!
Well, you should have just stayed...
on the carrot farm, huh?
It really is too bad.<br />I... I did like you.
What are you going to do? Kill me?
No, of course not.
He is.
No! Oh, Nick!
Yes, police! There's a savage fox...
in the Natural History Museum.
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
Since preds are just biologically...
predisposed to be savages.
Gosh. Think of the headline!
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."
So that's it? Prey fears predator...
and you stay in power?
Yeah, pretty much.
It won't work!
Fear always works.
And I'll dart every predator...
in Zootopia to keep it that way.
Oh, Nick.
No.
Bye-bye, bunny.
Bleh...
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.
All right, you know, you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it. I think we got it.
We got it up there,<br />thank you, Yakety-yak!
You laid it all out beautifully.
What?
Yeah... Oh, are you<br />looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.
What you've got in the weapon there?
Those are blueberries.<br />From my family's farm.
They are delicious.<br />You should try some.
I framed Lionheart.<br />I can frame you, too.
It's my word against yours.
Ooh, actually...
<i>And<br />I'll dart every predator . .</i>
<i>In Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>
...it's your word against yours.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.
<i>Former mayor Dawn Bellwether<br />is behind bars today...</i>
<i>guilty of masterminding<br />the savage attacks...</i>
<i>that have plagued Zootopia of late.</i>
<i>Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart...</i>
<i>denies any knowledge of her plot...</i>
<i>claiming he was just trying<br />to protect the city.</i>
<i>Did I falsely imprison those animals?</i>
<i>Well, yes. Yes, I did.</i>
<i>It was a classic<br />"doing the wrong thing...</i>
<i>"for the right reason" kind of a deal.</i>
<i>In related news, doctors say...</i>
<i>the Night Howler antidote<br />is proving effective...</i>
<i>in rehabilitating<br />the afflicted predators.</i>
