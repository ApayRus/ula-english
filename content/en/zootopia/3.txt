Give me<br />your tickets right now...
or I'm gonna kick your...
- meek little sheep butt.<br />- Ow!
Cut it out, Gideon!
Baa! Baa!<br />What are you gonna do? Cry?
Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
Nice costume, loser.
What crazy world are you living in...
where you think<br />a bunny could be a cop?
Kindly return my friend's tickets.
Come and get them.
But watch out, because I'm a fox...
and like you said in your<br />dumb little stage play...
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct<br />is still in our "Dunnah."
Uh, I'm pretty much sure<br />it's pronounced "DNA."
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
You don't scare me, Gideon.
You scared now?
Look at her nose twitch!
She is scared!
Cry little baby bunny.
Cry, Cry...
Oh, you don't know<br />when to quit, do you?
I want you to remember this moment...
the next time you think...
you will ever be anything more<br />than just a stupid...
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.
That looks bad.
Are you okay, Judy?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
- Here you go.<br />- Oh!
Wow! You got our tickets!
You're awesome, Judy!
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't<br />know what he's talking about.
Well, he was right about one thing.
I don't know when to quit.
