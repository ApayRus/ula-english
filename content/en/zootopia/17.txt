Closed. Great.
Mmm.<br />And I will bet you...
you don't have<br />a warrant to get in. Hmm?
Darn it. It's a bummer.
You wasted the day on purpose.
Madam, I have a fake badge.
I would never impede<br />your pretend investigation.
It's not a pretend<br />investigation. Look, see?
See him? This otter is missing.
Well, then they should've<br />gotten a real cop to find him.
What is your problem?
Does seeing me fail somehow<br />make you feel better...
about your own sad, miserable life?
It does. 100%.
Now, since you're sans warrant...
I guess we're... done?
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.
Hey!
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.<br />I wish I could've helped more.
The thing is, you don't need a warrant...
if you have probable cause...
and I'm pretty sure I saw...
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty. Come on.
2-9-T-H-D-0-3.<br />This is it!
Polar bear fur.
- Oh, my God!<br />- What? What?
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?
Carrots, if your otter was here...
he had a very bad day.
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?
No.
Oh, wait, look.
This is him,<br />Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.
What do you think happened?
Well, now,<br />wait a minute.
Polar bear fur,<br />Rat Pack music, fancy cup?
I know whose car this is. We got to go.
Why? Whose car is it?
The most feared crime-boss<br />in Tundratown.
They call him Mr. Big.
And he does not like me.<br />So we gotta go!
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.
Well, it's gonna be<br />an even bigger crime scene...
if Mr. Big finds me here...
so we're leaving right now.
Raymond!
And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.
And, speaking of "no see"...
how about you forget you saw me, huh?
For old times' sake?
That's a no.
