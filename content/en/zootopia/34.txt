Oh, Emmitt.
Thank you.
<i>When I was a kid...</i>
<i>...I thought Zootopia<br />was this perfect place.</i>
<i>Where everyone got along<br />and anyone could be anything.</i>
<i>Turns out...</i>
<i>real life's a little bit<br />more complicated...</i>
<i>than a slogan on a bumper sticker</i>
<i>Real life is messy.</i>
<i>We all have limitations.<br />We all make mistakes.</i>
<i>Which means, hey, glass half-full...</i>
<i>we all have a lot in common.</i>
<i>And the more we try<br />to understand one another...</i>
<i>the more exceptional<br />each of us will be.</i>
<i>But we have to try.</i>
<i>So, no matter what type<br />of animal you are...</i>
<i>from the biggest elephant...</i>
<i>to our first fox...</i>
<i>I implore you... Try.</i>
<i>Try to make the world a better place.</i>
<i>Look inside yourself...</i>
<i>and recognize that change...</i>
<i>starts with you.</i>
<i>It starts with me.</i>
<i>It starts with all of us.</i>
