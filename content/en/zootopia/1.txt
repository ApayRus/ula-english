<i>Fear.<br />Treachery. Bloodlust.</i>
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>
<i>these were the forces<br />that ruled our world.</i>
<i>A world where prey<br />were scared of predators.</i>
<i>And predators had an uncontrollable...</i>
<i>biological urge...</i>
<i>to maim, and maul, and...</i>
Blood! Blood! Blood!
And death.
Back then, the world was divided in two.
Vicious predator...
or meek prey.
But over time,<br />we evolved.
And moved beyond<br />our primitive, savage ways.
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.
And every young mammal has<br />multitudinous opportunities.
Yeah.
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.
Instead, I can be an astronaut.
I don't have to be<br />a lonely hunter anymore.
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.
I'm gonna be an actuary!
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...
a police officer!
Bunny cop?
That is the most<br />stupidest thing I ever heard.
It may seem impossible<br />to small minds...
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.
But, just 211 miles away...
stands the great city of Zootopia!
Where our ancestors first<br />joined together in peace...
and declared that anyone<br />can be anything!
Thank you and good night!
