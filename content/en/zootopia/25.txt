<i>Ladies<br />and gentlemammals.</i>
<i>14 mammals went missing...</i>
<i>and all 14 have been found<br />by our newest recruit...</i>
<i>who will speak to you in a moment.</i>
<i>But first let me remind you...</i>
Ugh. I'm so nervous.
Okay. Press Conference 101.
You wanna look smart?
Answer their question<br />with your own question...
and then answer that question.<br />Like this.
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps...
"uh, what can you tell us<br />about the case?"
"Well, was this a tough case?
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?
You should be there with me.
We did this together.
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.
Hmm. Funny you should say that...
because I've been thinking...
It would be nice to have a partner.
Here. In case you need<br />something to write with.
<i>At twenty-two hundred hours...</i>
<i>we found all these missing animals...</i>
Officer Hopps, it's time.
<i>They appear to be<br />in good health, physically . .</i>
<i>...if not emotionally</i>
So now, I'll turn things over...
to the officer who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.
- Officer Hopps!<br />- Officer Hopps!
Over here!
Yes?
What can you tell us about<br />the animals that went savage?
Well, the animals<br />in question, um...
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.
Okay, so what is the connection?
Oh, all we know is that they...
are all members of the predator family.
So, predators are<br />the only ones going savage?
That is ac... Yes, that is accurate. Yes.
Why? Why is this happening?
We still don't know.
It may have something<br />to do with biology.
What do you<br />mean by that?
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.
In their DNA? Can you<br />elaborate on that, please?
Yes, what I mean is,<br />thousands of years ago...
uh, predators survived through<br />their aggressive...
hunting instincts.
For whatever reason...
they seem to be reverting back...
to their primitive, savage ways.
Of course they did.
<i>Aw, is he gonna cry?</i>
Officer<br />Hopps, could it happen again?
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.
And we at the ZPD are prepared<br />and are here to protect you.
Will more mammals go savage?
What is being done to protect us?
Have you considered
a mandatory quarantine on predators?
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
Uh, that's all the time that we have.
No more questions.
Was I okay?
Oh, you did fine.
Oh, that went so fast.
I didn't get a chance to mention you...
or say anything about how we...
Oh, I think you said plenty.
What do you mean?
"Clearly there's<br />a biological component?"
"These predators may be<br />reverting back...
"to their primitive, savage ways?"
Are you serious?
I just stated the facts of the case.
I mean, it's not like<br />a bunny could go savage.
Right. But a fox could, huh?
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.
Oh, there's a "them" now?
Ugh. You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.
The kind that needs to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think...
you need to carry around fox repellent?
Yeah, don't think I didn't...
notice that little item<br />the first time we met.
So let me ask you a question.<br />Are you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts?
Do you think I might go savage?
Do you think I might try to...
eat you?
I knew it.
Just when I thought somebody<br />actually believed in me, huh.
Probably best if you don't<br />have a predator as a partner.
No. Nick. Nick!
Officer Hopps! Were you just<br />threatened by that predator?
No, he's my friend.
We can't even trust our own friends?
That is not what I said! Please!
Are we safe?
Have any<br />of our foxes gone savage?
