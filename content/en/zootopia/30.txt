Ooh, I thought you guys<br />only grew carrots.
Mmm. What's the plan?
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.
Okay. How?
Know this guy?
Uh-huh. I told you. I know everybody.
Well, hello. Step right up.<br />Anything you need, I got it.
All your favorite movies!
I got movies that haven't<br />even been released yet.
Hey, 15% off! 20!<br />Make me an offer! Come on!
Well, well, look who it is.<br />The duke of bootleg.
What's it to you, Wilde?
Shouldn't you be melting down<br />a Popsicle or something?
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.
We both know those<br />weren't moldy onions...
I caught you stealing.
What were you gonna do with...
those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!
And I ain't talking, rabbit.
And there ain't nothing<br />you can do to make me.
Ice him.
You dirty rat!
Why are you helping her? She's a cop!
And the godmother<br />to my future granddaughter.
I'm gonna name her Judy.
Oh!
Ice this weasel.
All right, all right, please!<br />I'll talk! I'll talk.
I stole them Night Howlers<br />so I could sell 'em.
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.
Money.
And to whom did you sell them?
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.
