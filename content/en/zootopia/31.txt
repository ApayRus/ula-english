Come on.
The weasel wasn't lying.
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered...
the market on Night Howlers.
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.
You serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.
I can hit him.
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter...
through the open window<br />of a moving car.
Yeah, I'll buzz you<br />when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.
Hey, Doug, open up!<br />We've got your latte.
All right. Woolter and Jesse<br />are back, so I'm leaving now.
Out.
Hey. Where<br />are you going? Get back here!
What are you doing?<br />He's gonna see you!
What are you looking at? Hey!
Whatever you're thinking,<br />stop thinking it. Carrots!
Carrots!
It better have<br />the extra foam this time.
