<i>By myself</i>
<i>You can't do nothing right babe</i>
<i>I'm a loser</i>
Oh, hey, it's my parents.
<i>Oh, there she is! Hi, sweetheart!</i>
<i>Hey there, Jude the dude.</i>
<i>How was your first day on the force?</i>
- It was real great.<br /><i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>Everything you ever hoped?</i>
Mmm. Absolutely.
And more.
Everyone's so nice<br />and I feel like I'm really...
- making a difference.<br /><i>- Wait a second.</i>
<i>Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.</i>
<i>Oh, my sweet heaven!</i>
<i>Judy. are you a meter maid?</i>
Oh, this? No! Oh, no. This is<br />just a temporary thing.
<i>Oh, it's the safest job on the force!</i>
<i>Oh, she's not a real cop.</i>
<i>Our prayers have been answered!</i>
<i>Glorious day!</i>
<i>Oh, meter maid! Meter maid!</i>
<i>- Meter maid! Meter maid!</i><br />- Dad. Dad. Dad!
It's been a really long day.<br />I should really...
<i>That's right you get some rest.</i>
<i>Those meters aren't gonna<br />maid themselves.</i>
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
Buh-bye.
Hey, buddy, turn down<br />that depressing music.
Leave<br />the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?
She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!<br />- You shut up!
You shut up!
You shut up!
Tomorrow's another day.
Yeah,<br />but it might be worse!
