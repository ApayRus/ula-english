Judy, you ever wonder<br />how your mom and me...
got to be so darn happy?
Nope.
Well, we gave up on our dreams<br />and we settled. Right, Bon?
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.<br />We settled hard.
See, that's the beauty<br />of complacency, Jude.
If you don't try anything new,<br />you'll never fail.
I like trying actually.
What you father means, hon...
is it's gonna be difficult...
impossible even, for you<br />to become a police officer.
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
- No.<br />- Bunnies don't do that.
- Never.<br />- Never.
Oh. Then, I guess<br />I'll have to be the first one.
Because I am gonna make...
the world a better place.
Or, uh, heck,<br />you know, you want to talk...
about making the world<br />a better place...
no better way to do it than<br />becoming a carrot farmer.
Yes! Your dad, me...
your 275 brothers and sisters.
- We're changing the world!<br />- Yeah.
- One carrot at a time.<br />- Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.
Mmm-hmm.
Just putting the seeds<br />in the ground.
Ah, at one with the soil.<br />Just getting covered in dirt.
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.
Yeah. Just as long as you don't...
believe in them too much.
Where'd the heck she go?
