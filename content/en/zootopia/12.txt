I was 30 seconds over!
Ugh! Yeah, you're a real hero, lady!
My mommy says she wishes<br />you were dead.
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.
I am a real cop. I am<br />a real cop. I am a real cop.
Hey, hey, hey! You, bunny!
Sir. If you have a grievance,
you may contest your citation<br />in traffic court.
What are you talking about? My shop!
- It was just robbed! Look!<br />- Oh!
He's getting away!
Are you a cop or not?
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir!<br />I've got this!
- Stop!<br />- Huh?
Stop, in the name of the law!
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa.
Coming through!
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!
Whoo-whoo!
Whoa!
Ha!
You!
Freeze!
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!
Stop!
Oh...
Oh!
Sorry. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!
Huh?
Ha! Oh...
Hey, stop right there!
Have a donut, copper!
Oh, my God. Did you see<br />those leopard print jeggings?
Oh!
I love your hair.
Thank you.
Come to papa.
