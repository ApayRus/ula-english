Listen up, cadets.
Zootopia has 12 unique...
ecosystems within its city limits.
Tundratown...
Sahara Square...
Rainforest District, to name a few.
You're gonna have<br />to master all of them...
before you hit the streets,<br />or guess what?
You'll be dead!
Scorching sandstorm!
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!
1,000-foot fall!
Whoa!
You're dead, Carrot Face!
Frigid ice wall!
Whoop!
You're dead, Farm Girl!
Enormous criminal.
You're dead. Dead, dead, dead!
Whoa...
Filthy toilet!
You're dead, Fluff Butt.
<i>Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!</i>
<i>There's never been<br />a bunny cop.</i>
<i>- Never.<br />- Never.</i>
<i>Just a stupid,<br />carrot-farming dumb bunny.</i>

Congratulations, Officer Hopps.
I won't let you down.

It's a real proud day for us little guys.

Okay, Officer Hopps.<br />Let's see those teeth!

Hold still. Smile!
