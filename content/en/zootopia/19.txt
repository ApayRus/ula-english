Mr. Manchas?
Judy Hopps, ZPD.
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.
You...
should be asking...
- what happened to me.<br />- Whoa!
Uh, a teensy otter did that?
What happened?
He was an animal.
<i>Down...</i>
<i>on all fours.</i>
<i>He was a savage!</i>
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about<br />the Night Howlers.
Over and over. The Night Howlers.
So you know about<br />the Night Howlers, too?
Good. Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers...
are exactly what we are here<br />to talk about.
- Right?<br />- Yup.
So, uh, so you just open the door...
and tell us what you know...
and we will tell you<br />what we know. Okay?
Okay.
Clever fox.
Mr. Manchas?
Buddy?
Are you...
okay?
Run. Run!
What is wrong with him?
I don't know!
Jump!
Come on!
- Head down!<br />- Oh. Oh!
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.
Are you familiar with Gazelle,<br />greatest singer
of our lifetime, angel with horns?
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.
Who's that beside her? Who is it?
<i>Wow, you are one hot dancer,<br />Benjamin Clawhauser</i>
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!
It's not, it's just a new app.<br />Hold on a second.
<i>Clawhauser!</i>
Clawhauser, listen to me,<br />we have a 10-91!
<i>Jaguar gone savage!</i>
Vine and Tuh-junja!
- It's "Tuh-hunga!"<br />- Whoa!
<i>Okay, we're<br />sending backup! Hopps?</i>
<i>Hopps!</i>
There!
Head for the sky trams!
Get in! Carrots.
Carrots!
Go!
No, no, no!
Buddy.
One predator to another...
No, no, no...
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...
so I'm just gonna give you<br />a little personal space! Ah!
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!
- I'm gonna let go!<br />- No, you, what?
- One, two...<br />- No...
I said, do not... Rabbit!
Carrots. You saved my life.
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.
