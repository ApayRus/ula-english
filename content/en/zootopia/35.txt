We have some new recruits<br />with us this morning...
including our first fox.
Who cares?
Huh, you should have your own line...
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

Just kidding!
We have reports of a street racer...
tearing up Savannah Central.
<i>Find him, shut him down.</i>
So, are all rabbits bad drivers...
or is it just you?
Oops. Sorry.

Dumb fox.
You know you love me.
Do I know that?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.
