<i>More bad news<br />in this city gripped by fear</i>
<i>A caribou is in critical condition...</i>
<i>the victim of a mauling...</i>
<i>by a savage polar bear</i>
<i>This, the 27th such attack,<br />comes just one week...</i>
<i>after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps<br />connected the violence...</i>
<i>to traditionally predatory animals.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, a peace rally organized...</i>
<i>by pop star Gazelle...</i>
<i>was marred by protest.</i>
<i>Go back to the forest predator!</i>
<i>I'm from the savanna!</i>
<i>Zootopia is a unique place.</i>
<i>It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...</i>
<i>where we celebrate our differences.</i>
<i>This is not the Zootopia I know</i>
<i>The Zootopia I know<br />is better than this.</i>
<i>We don't just blindly assign blame.</i>
<i>We don't know why these<br />attacks keep happening...</i>
<i>but it is irresponsible...</i>
<i>to label all predators as savages.</i>
That's not my Emmitt.
<i>We cannot<br />let fear divide us.</i>
<i>Please give me back<br />the Zootopia I love.</i>
