Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here's your cracker. Shove them<br />all the way down your throat.
Here. Have lots.
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.
It pains me to see you<br />reduced to this, Jasmine.
A beautiful desert bloom<br />such as yourself
should be on the arm of the most<br />powerful man in the world.
What do you say, my dear?
Why, with you as my queen...
Never.
I'll teach you some respect.
No. Genie.
I have decided to make my final wish.
I wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately in love with me.
Master, there are a few addendas,<br />some quid pro quos...
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.
You will do what I order you to do, slave.
Jafar.
I never realised how<br />incredibly handsome you are.
That's better.
Now, pussycat,
tell me more about myself.
You're tall, dark,
well dressed...
Al. Al, little buddy.
Al, I can't help you.
<i>I work for Se√±or Psychopath now.<br />What are you gonna do?</i>
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?<br />I'll improvise.
Cute little gaps between your teeth.
Go on.
And your beard is so twisted.
- You've stolen my heart.<br />- Jafar...
And the street rat?
What street rat?
That was...
You!
How many times<br />do I have to kill you, boy?
Get the lamp.
No!
Princess. Your time is up.
Jasmine.
Nice shot...
Don't toy with me.
Abu!
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.
Get the point?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,<br />you cowardly snake?
A snake, am I?
Perhaps you'd like to see<br />how snakelike I can be.
<i>Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake<br />Stick that sword into that snake</i>
You stay out of this.
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.<br />If he can't do it... Great!
Aladdin.
Jasmine, hang on.
You little fool.
You thought you could defeat<br />the most powerful being on Earth.
Squeeze him, Jafar.<br />Squeeze him like a...
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.
The genie. The genie.
The genie has more power<br />than you'll ever have.
What?
He gave you your power.<br />He can take it away.
Al, what are you doing?<br />Why are you bringing me into this?
Face it, Jafar.<br />You're still just second best.
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.
But not for long.
The boy is crazy.<br />He's a little punch-drunk.
One too many hits with the snake.
Slave, I make my third wish.
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!
All right, your wish is my command.<br />Way to go, Al.
Yes.
Yes!
The power.
The absolute power!
- What have you done?<br />- Trust me.
The universe is mine to command,<br />to control!
Not so fast, Jafar.<br />Aren't you forgetting something?
You wanted to be a genie, you got it.
What?
And everything that goes with it.
- No! No!<br />- I'm gettin' out of here.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
You're the genie. I don't want...
Itty bitty living space.
Al, you little genius, you.
