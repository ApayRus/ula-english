She was the princess. I can't believe it.
I must have sounded so stupid to her.
Aladdin! Hello!
Abu. Down here.
Come on, help me out of these.
Hey, she was in trouble.<br />She was worth it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, Abu.<br />I'll never see her again.
I'm a street rat, remember?<br />And there's a law.
She's gotta marry a prince.
She deserves a prince.
I'm a fool.
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Who are you?
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.
But together, perhaps we can be more.
I'm listening.
There is a cave, boy,<br />a Cave of Wonders,
filled with treasures<br />beyond your wildest dreams.
Treasure enough to impress<br />even your princess, I'd wager.
Jafar, can you hurry up?<br />I'm dyin' in here.
But the law says only a prince can...
You've heard of the golden rule,<br />haven't you?
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
Why would you share all of this<br />wonderful treasure with me?
I need a young pair of legs<br />and a strong back to go in after it.
One problem.
It's out there. We're in here.
Things aren't always what they seem.
So, do we have a deal?
I don't know.
