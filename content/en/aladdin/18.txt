<i>Make way for Prince Ali</i>
<i>Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"</i>
<i>Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar</i>
<i>Hey you, let us through<br />It's a bright new star</i>
<i>Oh come, be the first on your block<br />To meet his eye</i>
<i>Make way, here he comes<br />Ring bells, bang the drums</i>
<i>You're gonna love this guy</i>
<i>Prince Ali, fabulous he<br />Ali Ababwa</i>
<i>Genuflect, show some respect<br />Down on one knee</i>
<i>Now, try your best to stay calm</i>
<i>Brush up your Sunday salaam</i>
<i>Then come and meet<br />His spectacular coterie</i>
<i>Prince Ali, mighty is he<br />Ali Ababwa</i>
<i>Strong as 10 regular men definitely</i>
<i>He faced the galloping hordes</i>
<i>A hundred bad guys with swords</i>
<i>Who sent those goons to their lords?<br />Why, Prince Ali</i>
<i>He's got 75 golden camels</i>
Don't they look lovely, June?
<i>Purple peacocks, he's got 53</i>
Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.
<i>When it comes to exotic-type mammals</i>
<i>Has he got a zoo<br />I'm telling you</i>
<i>It's a world-class menagerie</i>
<i>Prince Ali, handsome is he<br />Ali Ababwa</i>
<i>That physique, how can I speak<br />Weak at the knee</i>
<i>Well, get on out in that square</i>
<i>Adjust your veil and prepare</i>
<i>To gawk and grovel and stare<br />At Prince Ali</i>
<i>- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys<br />- He's got the monkeys</i>
<i>- Let's see the monkeys<br />- And to view them he charges no fee</i>
<i>He's generous<br />So generous</i>
<i>He's got slaves<br />He's got servants and flunkies</i>
<i>Proud to work for him<br />They bow to his whim, love serving him</i>
<i>They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali</i>
<i>Prince Ali</i>
<i>Prince Ali, Amorous he<br />Ali Ababwa</i>
<i>Heard your princess<br />Was a sight lovely to see</i>
<i>And that, good people, is why</i>
<i>He got dolled up and dropped by</i>
<i>With 60 elephants, llamas galore</i>
<i>With bears and lions<br />A brass band and more</i>
<i>With his 40 fakirs<br />His cooks, his bakers</i>
<i>His birds that warble on key</i>
<i>Make way</i>
<i>For Prince Ali</i>
