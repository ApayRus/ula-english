Master, I don't think you quite realise<br />what you've got here.
So why don't you just ruminate<br />whilst I illuminate the possibilities.
<i>Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves</i>
<i>Scheherazade had a thousand tales</i>
<i>But, master, you're in luck<br />'Cause up your sleeves</i>
<i>You got a brand of magic never fails</i>
<i>You got some power<br />In your corner now</i>
<i>Some heavy ammunition in your camp</i>
<i>You got some punch, pizzazz<br />Yahoo and how</i>
<i>See, all you gotta do<br />Is rub that lamp and I'll say</i>
<i>"Mr. Aladdin, sir<br />What will your pleasure be?"</i>
<i>Let me take your order<br />Jot it down</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>
<i>Life is your restaurant<br />And I'm your maitre d'</i>
<i>Come on, whisper what it is you want</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>
<i>Yes, sir<br />We pride ourselves on service</i>
<i>You're the boss, the king, the shah</i>
<i>Say what you wish<br />It's yours, true dish</i>
<i>How 'bout a little more baklava?</i>
<i>Have some of column A<br />Try all of column B</i>
<i>I'm in the mood to help you, dude</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>
<i>Oh, my</i>
<i>No, no</i>
<i>My, my</i>
<i>Can your friends do this?</i>
<i>Can your friends do that?</i>
<i>Can your friends pull this</i>
<i>Out their little hat?</i>
<i>Can your friends go poof</i>
<i>Hey, looky here<br />Ha-ha!</i>
<i>Can your friends go<br />"Abracadabra, let her rip"</i>
<i>And then make the sucker disappear?</i>
<i>So don't you sit there<br />Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed</i>
<i>I'm here to answer<br />All your midnight prayers</i>
<i>You got me bona fide certified</i>
<i>You got a genie<br />For your charge d'affaires</i>
<i>I got a powerful urge to help you out</i>
<i>So what's your wish?<br />I really wanna know</i>
<i>You got a list<br />That's three miles long, no doubt</i>
<i>All you gotta do is rub like so</i>
<i>Mr. Aladdin, sir<br />Have a wish or two or three</i>
<i>I'm on the job, you big nabob</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend<br />Never had a friend</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend</i>
<i>Like me</i>
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>
So, what'll it be, master?
You're gonna grant me<br />any three wishes I want, right?
Almost.
There are a few provisos,<br />a couple of quid pro quos.
Like?
Rule number one, I can't kill anybody.
So don't ask.
Rule number two.
I can't make anybody<br />fall in love with anybody else.
<i>You little ponem there.</i>
Rule number three. I can't bring<br />people back from the dead.
It's not a pretty picture.<br />I don't like doing it.
Other than that, you got it.
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.
Can't even bring people<br />back from the dead.
I don't know, Abu. He probably<br />can't even get us out of this cave.
Looks like we're gonna have to<br />find a way out of here.
Excuse me?
Are you lookin' at me?<br />Did you rub my lamp?
Did you wake me up?<br />Did you bring me here?
And all of sudden<br />you're walking out on me?
I don't think so, not right now.
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
In case of emergency,
the exits are here, here,<br />here, here, anywhere.
Keep your hands and arms<br />inside the carpet.
We're...
Outta here!
