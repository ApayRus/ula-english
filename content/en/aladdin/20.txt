What am I gonna do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.
I should've known I couldn't pull off<br />this stupid prince wish.
So move.
Hey.
That's a good move.
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.
Genie, I need help.
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.
If you wanna court the little lady,<br />you gotta be a straight shooter.
- Do you got it?<br />- What?
No way.
If Jasmine found out I was really<br />some crummy street rat,
she'd laugh at me.
A woman appreciates a man<br />who can make her laugh.
Al, all joking aside,<br />you really ought to be yourself.
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.
How do I look?
Like a prince.
