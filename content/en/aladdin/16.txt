Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet<br />for all your travel needs.
Don't stand until the rug<br />has come to a complete stop.
Thank you. Goodbye now.<br />Good-bye. Thank you.
Well, how about that,<br />Mr Doubting Mustafa?
You sure showed me.<br />Now, about my three wishes.
Dost mine ears deceive me?
Three? You are down by one, boy.
No. I never actually wished<br />to get out of the cave.
You did that on your own.
Well, I feel sheepish.
All right, you bad boy,<br />but no more freebies.
Fair deal. So, three wishes.
I want them to be good.
What would you wish for?
Me?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well, in my case... Forget it.
- What?<br />- No, I can't. I...
Come on. Tell me.
Freedom.
You're a prisoner?
It's all part and parcel<br />of the whole genie gig.
Phenomenal cosmic powers...
Itty bitty living space.
Genie, that's terrible.
But to be free...
Not have to go, "What do you need?
"What do you need?<br />What do you need?"
To be my own master.
Such a thing would be greater<br />than all the magic
and all the treasures in all the world.
But what am I talking about?
Let's get real here.<br />It's not gonna happen.
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Why not?
The only way I get outta this<br />is if my master wishes me out.
So you can guess how often<br />that's happened.
I'll do it. I'll set you free.
- Yeah, right.<br />- No, really, I promise.
After I make my first two wishes,
I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Well, here's hopin'. All right.
Let's make some magic.
So how 'bout it?<br />What is it you want most?
Well, there's this girl.
Wrong.
I can't make anybody<br />fall in love, remember?
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
- Pretty?<br />- Beautiful.
She's got these eyes that just...<br />And this hair.
And her smile...
<i>Ami.</i>
<i>C'est I'amour.</i>
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...
Hey, can you make me a prince?
Let's see here.
Chicken à la king? Nope.
Alaskan king crab.<br />I hate it when they do that.
<i>Caesar salad. Et tu, Brute? No.</i>
Aha. "To make a prince. "
Is that an official wish?<br />Say the magic words.
Genie, I wish for you<br />to make me a prince.
All right!
First, that fez-and-vest combo<br />is much too third century.
These patches.<br />What are we trying to say, beggar?
No. Let's work with me here.
<i>Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.</i>
Now, it still needs something.<br />What does it say to me?
It says mode of transportation.
<i>Excuse me, monkey boy.<br />Aquí. Over here.</i>
Here he comes.
What better way to make your<br />entrance on the streets of Agrabah
than riding<br />your very own, brand-new camel?
Watch out. They spit.
Not enough.
Still not enough.<br />Let's see. What do you need?
Yes!
Talk about your trunk space.<br />Check this action out.
Abu, you look good.
He's got the outfit.<br />He's got the elephant.
But we're not through yet.
Hang on to your turban, kid.<br />We're gonna make you a star.
