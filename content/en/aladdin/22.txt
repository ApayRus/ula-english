<i>I can show you the world</i>
<i>Shining, shimmering, splendid</i>
<i>Tell me, Princess</i>
<i>Now, when did you last<br />Let your heart decide</i>
<i>I can open your eyes</i>
<i>Take you wonder by wonder</i>
<i>Over, sideways and under</i>
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>
<i>A whole new world</i>
<i>A new fantastic point of view</i>
<i>No one to tell us no<br />Or where to go</i>
<i>Or say we're only dreaming</i>
<i>A whole new world</i>
<i>A dazzling place<br />I never knew</i>
<i>But when I'm way up here<br />It's crystal clear</i>
<i>That now I'm in<br />A whole new world with you</i>
<i>Now I'm in<br />A whole new world with you</i>
<i>Unbelievable sights</i>
<i>Indescribable feeling</i>
<i>Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</i>
<i>Through an endless diamond sky</i>
<i>- A whole new world<br />- Don't you dare close your eyes</i>
<i>- A hundred thousand things to see<br />- Hold your breath, it gets better</i>
<i>I'm like a shooting star<br />I've come so far</i>
<i>I can't go back to where I used to be</i>
<i>- A whole new world<br />- Every turn a surprise</i>
<i>- With new horizons to pursue<br />- Every moment red-letter</i>
<i>I'll chase them anywhere<br />There's time to spare</i>
<i>Let me share<br />This whole new world with you</i>
<i>- A whole new world<br />- A whole new world</i>
<i>- That's where we'll be<br />- That's where we'll be</i>
<i>- A thrilling chase<br />- A wondrous place</i>
<i>For you and me</i>
- It's all so magical.<br />- Yeah.
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
Nah. He hates fireworks.
He doesn't like flying, either.
That is... Oh, no.
You are the boy from the market.<br />I knew it.
- Why did you lie to me?<br />- Jasmine, I'm sorry.
- Did you think I was stupid?<br />- No.
- That I wouldn't figure it out?<br />- No.
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.<br />No, that's not what I meant.
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The truth.
The truth is...
I sometimes dress as a commoner
to escape the pressures of palace life.
But I really am a prince.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Well, you know,
royalty going out into the city<br />in disguise,
it sounds a little strange,<br />don't you think?
Not that strange.
Good night, my handsome prince.
Sleep well, Princess.
Yes!
For the first time in my life,<br />things are starting to go right.
