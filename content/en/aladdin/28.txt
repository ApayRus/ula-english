Get your blasted beak out of my face.
- Shut up, you moron.<br />- Don't tell me to shut up.
Allow me.
Ten thousand years in a<br />Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.
Shut up!
Jasmine...
I'm sorry I lied to you<br />about being a prince.
I know why you did.
Well, I guess this is good-bye?
That stupid law. This isn't fair.
I love you.
Al, no problem.<br />You've still got one wish left.
Just say the word<br />and you're a prince again.
But, Genie, what about your freedom?
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.
This is love.
Al, you're not gonna find another girl<br />like her in a million years.
Believe me, I know. I've looked.
Jasmine, I do love you,
but I got to stop pretending<br />to be something I'm not.
I understand.
Genie, I wish for your freedom.
One bona fide<br />prince pedigree coming up.
- What?<br />- Genie, you're free.
I'm free. I'm free.
Quick. Quick.<br />Wish for something outrageous.
Say, "I want the Nile. "<br />Wish for the Nile. Try that.
- I wish for the Nile.<br />- No way!
Does that feel good!
I'm free! I'm free at last!
I'm hittin' the road.<br />I'm off to see the world.
Genie, I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.
Me, too, Al.
No matter what anybody says,
you'll always be a prince to me.
That's right.
You've certainly proven your worth<br />as far as I'm concerned.
It's that law that's the problem.
- Father?<br />- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?
From this day forth,
the princess shall marry<br />whomever she deems worthy.
Him. I choose...
I choose you, Aladdin.
Call me Al.
All of you, come over here.<br />Big group hug.
Group hug.
Mind if I kiss the monkey?
Hairball.
Well, I can't do any more damage<br />around this popsicle stand.
I'm outta here!
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.
No, I'm mythology.
I don't care what I am. I'm free!
<i>A whole new world</i>
<i>A whole new life</i>
<i>For you and me</i>
<i>A whole new world</i>
Made you look.
