Let them cheer.
You know, Al, I'm getting really...
I don't think you're him.<br />Tonight, the part of Al
will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.
- I am your master now.<br />- I was afraid of that.
Genie, grant me my first wish.
I wish to rule on high as sultan.
Bless my soul.
What is this? What's going on?
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Father.
Jafar, you vile betrayer.
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.
The lamp.
Finders keepers, Abubu.
Genie, no!
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.
Jafar, I order you to stop.
But there's a new order now.
My order.
Finally, you will bow to me.
We will never bow to you.
Why am I not surprised?
If you won't bow before a sultan,
then you will cower before a sorcerer!
Genie, my second wish...
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer<br />in the world!
Genie, stop!
Ladies and gentlemen,
a warm Agrabah welcome<br />for Sorcerer Jafar!
Now, where were we?
Yes. Abject humiliation.
Down, boy.
Princess.
There's someone<br />I'm dying to introduce you to.
Jafar. Get your hands off her.
<i>Prince Ali<br />Yes, it is he</i>
<i>But not as you know him</i>
<i>Read my lips<br />And come to grips with reality</i>
<i>Yes, meet a blast from yourpast</i>
<i>Whose lies were too good to last</i>
<i>Say hello<br />To your precious Prince Ali</i>
Or should we say Aladdin?
Ali?
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...
<i>So Ali turns out to be<br />Merely Aladdin</i>
<i>Just a con, need I go on</i>
<i>Take it from me</i>
<i>His personality flaws</i>
<i>Give me adequate cause</i>
<i>To send him packing<br />On a one-way trip</i>
Genie!
<i>So his prospects<br />Take a terminal dip</i>
<i>His assets frozen, the venue chosen<br />Is the ends of the Earth, whoopee!</i>
- So long!<br />- Good-bye, see ya.
<i>Ex-Prince Ali</i>
Abu.
Abu!
This is all my fault.
I should have freed the genie<br />when I had the chance.
Abu. Are you okay?
I'm sorry, Abu.
I made a mess of everything.
Somehow, I gotta go back<br />and set things right.
Carpet.
Abu, start digging.
That's it.
Yeah! All right!
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.
