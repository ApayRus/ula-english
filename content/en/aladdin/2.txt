You are late.
A thousand apologies, O patient one.
You have it, then?
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.
The treasure.
Trust me, my pungent friend.
- You'll get what's coming to you.<br />- What's coming to you.
Quickly! Follow the trail.
Faster.
At last, after all my years of searching,
the Cave of Wonders.
Cave of Wonders.
By Allah.
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.
The rest of the treasure is yours,<br />but the lamp is mine.
The lamp. The lamp.
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?
Who disturbs my slumber?
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Know this.
Only one may enter here,
one whose worth lies far within.
A diamond in the rough.
What are you waiting for? Go on.
No!
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
I can't believe it. I just don't believe it.
We're never gonna get<br />a hold of that stupid lamp.
Just forget it. Look at this.<br />I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.
Patience, Iago. Patience.
Gazeem was obviously<br />less than worthy.
There's a big surprise.
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack<br />and die from that surprise.
What are we gonna do?<br />We got a big problem here, a big...
Yes.
Only one may enter.
I must find this one, this...
Diamond in the rough.
