Jafar, this is an outrage.
If it weren't for all your years<br />of loyal service...
From now on, you are to discuss<br />sentencing of prisoners with me,
before they are beheaded.
I assure you, Your Highness,<br />it won't happen again.
Jasmine...
Jafar. Let's put this whole<br />messy business behind us.
Please.
My most abject and humblest apologies<br />to you as well, Princess.
At least some good will come<br />of my being forced to marry.
When I am queen,<br />I will have the power to get rid of you.
There, now. That's nice.<br />All settled, then.
Now, Jasmine, getting back<br />to this suitor business... Jasmine?
Jasmine!
If only I had gotten that lamp.
"I will have the power to get rid of you. "
To think we gotta keep kissing up
to that chump and his chump daughter
- for the rest of our lives...<br />- No, Iago.
Only until she finds a chump husband.
Then she'll have us banished.
Or beheaded.
Wait a minute. Jafar.
What if you were the chump husband?
What?
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?
And then you become the sultan.
Marry the shrew.
I become the sultan.
- The idea has merit.<br />- Yes, merit. Yes.
And then we drop papa-in-law<br />and the little woman off a cliff.
I love the way<br />your foul little mind works.
