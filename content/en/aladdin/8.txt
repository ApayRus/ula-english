With all due respect, Your Rottenness,
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Save your breath, lago. Faster.
Yes, O mighty evil one.
Part, sands of time.
Reveal to me the one<br />who can enter the cave.
Yes! Yes!
There he is.
My diamond in the rough.
That's him? That's the clown<br />we've been waitin' for?
Let's have the guards extend him<br />an invitation to the palace, shall we?
Swell.
Almost there.
I want to thank you<br />for stopping that man.
Forget it.
So, this is your first time<br />in the marketplace?
Is it that obvious?
Well, you do kind of stand out.
I mean, you don't seem to know<br />how dangerous Agrabah can be.
I'm a fast learner.
Hey.
Come on. This way.
Watch your head there.
Be careful.
Is this where you live?
Yep. Just me and Abu.<br />Come and go as we please.
That sounds fabulous.
Well, it's not much,<br />but it's got a great view.
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
It's wonderful.
I wonder what it would<br />be like to live there,
and have servants and valets.
Sure. People who tell you<br />where to go and how to dress.
It's better than here.
You're always scraping for food<br />and ducking the guards.
You're not free<br />to make your own choices.
- Sometimes you feel so...<br />- You're just...
- Trapped.<br />- Trapped.
So, where are you from?
What does it matter?
I ran away and I am not going back.
- Really? How come?<br />- Why, you...
My father's forcing me to get married.
That's awful.
Abu!
What?
Abu says that's not fair.
What?
- Oh, did he?<br />- Yeah, of course.
And does Abu<br />have anything else to say?
Well, he wishes there was something<br />he could do to help.
Oh, boy.
Tell him that's very sweet.
Here you are.
- They're after me!<br />- They're after you?
My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?<br />- What?
- Do you trust me?<br />- Yes...
Then jump!
We just keep running into each other,<br />don't we, street rat?
Run! Go! Get out of here!
Get this thing off of me!
- It's the dungeon for you, boy.<br />- Get off of me.
Let him go.
Looky here, men. A street mouse.
Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?<br />- Princess?
What are you doing outside the palace?<br />And with this street rat.
That's not your concern.<br />Do as I command. Release him.
I would, Princess,<br />except my orders come from Jafar.
- You'll have to take it up with him.<br />- Believe me, I will.
