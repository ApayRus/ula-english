Princess Jasmine?
- Who's there?<br />- It's me, Prince Ali.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
I do not want to see you.
No, no, please, Princess.<br />Give me a chance.
- Just leave me alone.<br />- Down, kitty.
So, how's our little beau doing?
Good kitty, take off.
Down, kitty.
Wait. Wait.
Do I know you?
No. No.
You remind me of someone<br />I met in the marketplace.
The marketplace?
I have servants who go<br />to the marketplace for me.
Why, I even have servants who go to<br />the marketplace for my servants,
so it couldn't have been me you met.
No. I guess not.
Enough about you, Casanova.<br />Talk about her.
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.
Anything. Pick a feature.
Princess Jasmine? You're very...
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,
- punctual.<br />- Punctual.
- Punctual?<br />- Sorry.
- Beautiful.<br />- Nice recovery.
I'm rich, too, you know.
- Yeah.<br />- The daughter of a sultan.
I know.
A fine prize for any prince to marry.
Right. Right. A prince like me.
Warning! Warning!
Right. A prince like you.
And every other stuffed shirt,<br />swaggering peacock I've met.
Mayday! Mayday!
Just go jump off a balcony!
- What?<br />- Stop her. Stop her!
- Want me to sting her?<br />- Buzz off.
Okay, fine.<br />But remember, "bee" yourself.
- Yeah, right.<br />- What?
You're right.
You aren't just some prize to be won.
You should be free<br />to make your own choice.
I'll go now.
- No!<br />- What? What?
How...
How are you doing that?
- It's a magic carpet.<br />- It's lovely.
You...
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace,<br />see the world.
- Is it safe?<br />- Sure. Do you trust me?
- What?<br />- Do you trust me?
Yes.
