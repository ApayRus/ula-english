Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.
Your Majesty,
I have journeyed from afar<br />to seek your daughter's hand.
Prince Ali Ababwa.
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.<br />He's delighted, too.
Ecstatic.
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...<br />- Ababwa.
Whatever.
You cannot just parade in here<br />uninvited and expect to...
By Allah,<br />this is quite a remarkable device.
I don't suppose I might...
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.<br />Allow me.
Sire, I must advise against this.
Button up, Jafar.<br />Learn to have a little fun.
Look out, here I come.
Just where did you say you were from?
Much farther than<br />you've travelled, I'm sure.
- Try me.<br />- Look out, Polly.
Hey, watch it.
Watch it with the dumb rug.
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.
- Spectacular, Your Highness.<br />- That was lovely.
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.
If we're lucky, you won't<br />have to marry Jasmine after all.
- I don't trust him, Sire.<br />- Nonsense.
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,<br />I'm an excellent judge of character.
Excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!
Jasmine will like this one.
And I'm pretty sure<br />I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Your Highness, no.<br />I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.
This boy is no different from the others.
What makes him think<br />he is worthy of the princess?
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.
Just let her meet me.<br />I will win your daughter.
How dare you.
All of you.<br />Standing around deciding my future?
I am not a prize to be won.
Oh, dear.
Don't worry, Prince Ali.<br />Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
I think it's time to say good-bye<br />to Prince Abubu.
