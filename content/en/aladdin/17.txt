Sire, I've found a solution<br />to the problem with your daughter.
The problem with your daughter.
Really?
Right here.
"If the princess has not chosen<br />a husband by the appointed time,
"then the sultan shall choose for her. "
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could I choose someone<br />she hates?
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.
"If in the event<br />a suitable prince cannot be found... "
Jerk.
"A princess must then be wed to... "
Interesting.
What? Who?
The royal vizier.
Why, that would be me.
But I thought the law says<br />that only a prince can marry a princess.
I'm quite sure that...
Desperate times call<br />for desperate measures, my lord.
Yes. Desperate measures.
You will order the princess to marry me.
I will order the princess to...
But you're so old.
The princess will marry me.
The princess will marry...
What? What is that?
That music.
Jafar, you must come and see this.
