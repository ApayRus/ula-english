On his way to the palace, I suppose.
Another suitor for the princess.
Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Hey!
If I were as rich as you,<br />I could afford some manners.
I'll teach you some manners.
Look at that, Abu.
It's not every day you see<br />a horse with two rear ends.
You are a worthless street rat.
You were born a street rat,<br />you'll die a street rat,
and only your fleas will mourn you.
I'm not worthless.
And I don't have fleas.
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.
<i>Riffraff, street rat</i>
<i>I don't buy that</i>
<i>If only they'd look closer</i>
<i>Would they see a poor boy?</i>
<i>No, siree</i>
<i>They'd find out</i>
<i>There's so much more</i>
<i>To me</i>
Someday, Abu,<br />things are gonna change.
We'll be rich, live in a palace,
and never have any problems at all.
