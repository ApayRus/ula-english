I've never been so insulted.
Prince Achmed.<br />You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Good luck marrying her off.
Jasmine.
Jasmine!
Confound it, Rajah.
So, this is why<br />Prince Achmed stormed out.
Oh, Father.
Rajah was just playing with him.<br />Weren't you, Rajah?
You were just playing<br />with that overdressed,
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,<br />weren't you?
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting<br />every suitor who comes to call.
The law says<br />you must be married to a prince
by your next birthday.
The law is wrong.
You've only got three more days.
Father, I hate being forced into this.
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Jasmine,
it's not only this law.
I'm not going to be around forever,<br />and, well, I...
I just want to make sure<br />you're taken care of.
Provided for.
Please try to understand.
I've never done a thing on my own.<br />I've never had any real friends.
Except you, Rajah.
I've never even been outside<br />the palace walls.
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Then maybe I don't want<br />to be a princess any more.
Allah forbid you should<br />have any daughters.
