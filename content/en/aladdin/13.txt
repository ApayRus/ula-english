Jasmine?
Oh, dearest.
What's wrong?
Jafar has
done something terrible.
There, there, my dear.
We'll set it right.
Now, tell me everything.
Aladdin. Wake up.
Aladdin.
My head.
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal!
Whoever he was,<br />he's long gone with that lamp.
Why, you hairy little thief.
Looks like such a beat-up,<br />worthless piece ofjunk.
Hey, I think there's<br />something written here,
but it's hard to make out.
10,000 years will give you<br />such a crick in the neck.
Hang on a second.
Does it feel good to be outta there.
I'm telling you,<br />nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Hi. Where you from?<br />What's your name?
Aladdin.
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.<br />Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al?<br />Or maybe just Din?
How about Laddie? Sounds like,<br />"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie. "
I must have hit my head<br />harder than I thought.
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?
Oh, sorry, Cheeta.<br />Hope I didn't singe the fur.
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you<br />in a few millennia.
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.
Say, you're a lot smaller<br />than my last master.
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.
Look at me from the side.<br />Do I look different to you?
Wait a minute. I'm your master?
That's right. He can be taught.<br />What would you wish of me?
The ever impressive,
the long contained,
the often imitated,
but never duplicated...
Duplicated, duplicated...
Genie of the Lamp!
Right here direct from the lamp,
right here<br />for your very much wish fulfilment.
Thank you.
- Wish fulfilment?<br />- Three wishes, to be exact.
And ixnay on the wishing<br />for more wishes.
<i>That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres.</i>
