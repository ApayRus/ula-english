Jafar?
Princess.
Jafar, I'm stuck.
How may I be of service to you?
The guards just took a boy<br />from the market, on your orders.
Your father has charged me<br />with keeping peace in Agrabah.
- The boy was a criminal.<br />- What was his crime?
I can't breathe, Jafar.
Why, kidnapping the princess,<br />of course.
If you could just... That hurt!
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.
Oh, dear.
How frightfully upsetting.<br />Had I but known...
What do you mean?
Sadly, the boy's sentence<br />has already been carried out.
What sentence?
Death.
- By beheading.<br />- No.
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
How could you?
So, how did it go?
I think she took it rather well.
It's all my fault, Rajah.
I didn't even know his name.
