I don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.
Jafar.
My most trusted advisor.
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
My life is but to serve you, my lord.
It's this suitor business.<br />Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.
- I'm at my wit's end.<br />- Wit's end!
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Your Majesty certainly<br />has a way with dumb animals.
Now, then,<br />perhaps I can divine a solution
to this thorny problem.
If anyone can help, it's you.
But it would require the use<br />of the mystic blue diamond.
My ring?
But it's been in the family for years.
It is necessary to find<br />the princess a suitor.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
The diamond.
Here, Jafar.
Whatever you need will be fine.
You are most gracious, my liege.
Now, run along and play<br />with your little toys.
Yes. That will be pretty good.
I can't take it any more!
If I gotta choke down on one more<br />of those mouldy, disgusting crackers...
Calm yourself, lago.
Then I'd grab him around the head.
Soon I will be sultan,<br />not that addlepated twit.
And then I stuff the crackers<br />down his throat.
