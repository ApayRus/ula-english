Jasmine.
Father, I just had<br />the most wonderful time.
- I'm so happy.<br />- You should be, Jasmine.
I have chosen a husband for you.
- What?<br />- You will wed Jafar.
You're speechless, I see.<br />A fine quality in a wife.
I will never marry you.
- Father, I choose Prince Ali.<br />- Prince Ali left.
Better check<br />your crystal ball again, Jafar.
Prince Ali!
How in the...
Tell them the truth, Jafar.<br />You tried to have me killed.
What? Ridiculous nonsense,<br />Your Highness.
He is obviously lying.
Obviously lying.
Father, what's wrong with you?
I know what's wrong.
Oh, my!
Your Highness,<br />Jafar's been controlling you with this.
What? Jafar?
You, you traitor!
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.
Guards! Guards!
Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it.
Just dig a grave for both of us.<br />We're dead.
Arrest Jafar at once.
This is not done yet, boy.
Find him! Search everywhere!
- Jasmine, are you all right?<br />- Yes.
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor,
plotting against me all this time.
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will I ever...
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
Praise Allah!
You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.
I won't. I'll leave that to my...
But you two will be wed at once.
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy<br />and prosperous,
and then you, my boy,<br />will become sultan.
- Sultan?<br />- Yes.
A fine upstanding youth<br />such as yourself,
a person of your unimpeachable<br />moral character
is exactly what this kingdom needs.
We gotta get outta here.<br />I gotta start packing. Only essentials.
We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the weapons,<br />the knives, and how about this picture?
I think I'm making a weird face in it.
Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts.
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!
Good grip.
Prince Ali is nothing more than<br />that ragged urchin, Aladdin.
- He has the lamp, lago.<br />- Why, that miserable...
But you are going to relieve him of it.
Me?
