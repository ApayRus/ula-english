Wait here.
This is it?
This is what we came<br />all the way down here to...
Abu! No!
Infidels!
You have touched<br />the forbidden treasure!
Now you will never again<br />see the light of day!
Help! Help! Help!
Gotcha!
Carpet, let's move.
Abu!
Abu, this is no time to panic.
Start panicking.
- Help me out.<br />- Throw me the lamp.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
First give me the lamp.
Yes!
At last!
What are you doing?
Giving you your reward.
Your eternal reward.
It's mine.
It's all mine.
I... Where is it?
No.
No!
