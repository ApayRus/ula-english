I'm sorry, Rajah.
But I can't stay here<br />and have my life lived for me.
I'll miss you.
Goodbye.
Okay, Abu. Go.
Try this. Your taste buds<br />will dance and sing.
Get your paws off that.
Why, you...
Get away from here,<br />you cursed, filthy ape!
Goodbye.
Nice going, Abu.
Breakfast is served.
Pretty lady, buy a pot.<br />No finer pot in brass or silver.
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.
Fresh fish!
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Oh, no. I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I'm really very sorry.
Hello? Hello?
You must be hungry.
Here you go.
You'd better be able to pay for that.
- Pay?<br />- No one steals from my cart.
I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.
- Thief!<br />- Please...
If you let me go to the palace,<br />I can get some from the sultan.
Do you know<br />what the penalty is for stealing?
No! No, please!
Thank you, kind sir.<br />I'm so glad you found her.
I've been looking all over for you.
- What are you doing?<br />- Just play along.
You know this girl?
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.
She's a little crazy.
She said she knew the sultan.
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
Tragic, isn't it?
But no harm done.
Now, come along, sis.<br />Time to go see the doctor.
Hello, Doctor. How are you?
No, no, no. Not that one.<br />Come on, Sultan.
What?
Come back here, you little thieves!
