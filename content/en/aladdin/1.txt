<i>Oh, I come from a land<br />From a faraway place</i>
<i>Where the caravan camels roam</i>
<i>Where it's flat and immense<br />And the heat is intense</i>
<i>It's barbaric, but hey, it's home</i>
<i>When the wind's from the east<br />And the sun's from the west</i>
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>
<i>Come on down, stop on by<br />Hop a carpet and fly</i>
<i>To another Arabian night</i>
<i>Arabian nights</i>
<i>Like Arabian days</i>
<i>More often than not<br />Are hotter than hot</i>
<i>In a lot of good ways</i>
<i>Arabian nights</i>
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>
<i>A fool off his guard<br />Could fall and fall hard</i>
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>
<i>Ah, salaam and good evening<br />to you, worthy friend.</i>
Please, please, come closer.
Too close. A little too close.
There.
Welcome to Agrabah,
city of mystery, of enchantment,
and the finest merchandise<br />this side of the River Jordan,
on sale today. Come on down.
Look at this. Yes.
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.<br />Also makes julienne fries.
Will not break. Will not...
It broke.
Look at this.
I have never seen<br />one of these intact before.
This is the famous<br />Dead Sea Tupperware.
Listen. Still good.
Wait. Don't go.
I can see that you're only interested<br />in the exceptionally rare.
I think, then, you would be<br />most rewarded to consider this.
Do not be fooled<br />by its commonplace appearance.
Like so many things,<br />it is not what is outside,
but what is inside that counts.
This is no ordinary lamp.
It once changed the course<br />of a young man's life.
A young man who, like this lamp,<br />was more than what he seemed.
A diamond in the rough.
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
It begins on a dark night,
<i>where a dark man waits</i>
<i>with a dark purpose.</i>
