Stop! Thief!
I'll have your hands for a trophy,<br />street rat.
All this for a loaf of bread?
- There he is!<br />- You won't get away so easy!
You think that was easy?
You two, over that way,<br />and you, follow me.
- We'll find him.<br />- Morning, ladies.
Getting into trouble a little early<br />today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Trouble? No way.<br />You're only in trouble if you get caught.
- Gotcha.<br />- I'm in trouble.
And this time...
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.
- Abu.<br />- Come on. Let's get outta here.
<i>Gotta keep one jump<br />Ahead of the bread line</i>
<i>One swing ahead of the sword</i>
<i>I steal only what I can't afford</i>
<i>That's everything</i>
<i>One jump ahead of the lawmen</i>
<i>That's all, and that's no joke</i>
<i>These guys don't appreciate I'm broke</i>
<i>- Riffraff<br />- Street rat</i>
<i>- Scoundrel<br />- Take that</i>
<i>Just a little snack, guys</i>
<i>Rip him open<br />Take it back, guys</i>
<i>I can take a hint<br />Gotta face the facts</i>
<i>- You're my only friend, Abu<br />- Who?</i>
<i>Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom</i>
<i>He's become a one-man rise in crime</i>
<i>I'd blame parents<br />Except he hasn't got 'em</i>
<i>Gotta eat to live<br />Gotta steal to eat</i>
<i>Tell you all about it<br />When I got the time</i>
<i>One jump ahead of the slowpokes<br />One skip ahead of my doom</i>
<i>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</i>
<i>There he is</i>
<i>One jump ahead of the hit men<br />One hit ahead of the flock</i>
<i>I think I'll take a stroll<br />Around the block</i>
<i>- Stop, thief<br />- Vandal</i>
<i>- Abu<br />- Scandal</i>
<i>Let's not be too hasty</i>
<i>Still I think he's rather tasty</i>
<i>Gotta eat to live<br />Gotta steal to eat</i>
<i>Otherwise we'd get along</i>
<i>Wrong</i>
Get him!
He's got a sword!
You idiots. We've all got swords.
<i>- One jump ahead of the hoofbeats<br />- Vandal!</i>
<i>- One hop ahead of the hump<br />- Street rat!</i>
<i>- One trick ahead of disaster<br />- Scoundrel!</i>
<i>They're quick, but I'm much faster</i>
<i>Here goes, better throw my hand in</i>
<i>Wish me happy landin'<br />All I gotta do is jump</i>
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.<br />All right.
Here. Go on. Take it.
Don't.
