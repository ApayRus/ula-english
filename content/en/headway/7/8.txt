Tapescript 7.8
What do I remember of the nineties … er … well,
I left school in 1994
and I went to university.
I studied graphic design –
it was really good.
I had a good time.
Then after university, in 1997,
I was really lucky.
I got a job immediately.
A job with Saatchi and Saatchi,
they’re an advertising agency in London.
Soon after that,
1998 it was,
I met Zoe,
she’s my girlfriend.
She has a good job, too,
and we bought a flat together in 1999.
The only sport I like is football,
so I remember when France won the World Cup in 1998.
Brazil lost in ’98
but they won in ’94.
I remember when Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997,
that was just after I started at Saatchi and Saatchi.
Oh, and I remember Bill Clinton
and all the problems he had in his last years in the White House.
And the Euro –
eleven countries in Europe began to use the Euro in 1999,
but Britain didn’t.
Oh yes – and of course
I remember Princess Diana –
she died in a car crash in Paris in ’97
and millions of people came to London for her funeral.
I was there.
I can remember it really well.
