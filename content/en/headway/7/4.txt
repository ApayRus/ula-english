Tapescript 7.4
I worked
from 6.00 in the morning
until 10.00 at night.
Sixteen hours in the cotton fields
and I only earned $2 a day.
I sure hated that job
but I loved the poems in my head.
I really wanted to learn to read and write.
When I was sixteen I married Hubert,
and soon there were six children,
five sons,
then a daughter,
Lily.
Hubert died
just before she was born.
That was sixty-five years ago.
So I looked after my family alone.
There was no time for learning,
but my children,
they all learned to read and write –
that was important to me.
And when did I learn to read and write?
I didn’t learn until I was 86,
and now I have
three books of poems.
