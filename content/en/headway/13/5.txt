Tapescript 13.5
Part 2
The tale of horribly good Bertha
‘Once upon a time, a long time ago
there was a little girl called Bertha.
She was always well behaved
and worked hard at school to please her parents
and her teachers.
She was never late,
never dirty or untidy,
never rude,
and she never told lies.’
The children on the train began to look bored.
‘Was she pretty?’
asked the smaller girl.
‘No,’
said the young man.
‘She wasn’t pretty at all.
She was just horribly good.
Bertha was so good
that she won three gold medals.
One said
Never late,
one said
Always polite,
and the third said
Best child in the world.’
‘Yuk!’
said the three children.
‘Anyway,’
said the young man,
‘Bertha was so good
that the king invited her to his palace.
So she put on her best clean white dress
and she pinned her three medals to the front
and she walked through the woods to the king’s palace.
But in the woods
there lived a big hungry wolf.
He saw Bertha’s lovely white dress through the trees
and he heard the medals clinking together as she walked.
‘Aha!’ thought the wolf.
‘Lunch!’
And he started to move quickly
but quietly through the trees
towards Bertha.’
‘Oh no!’
cried the children.
‘Is he going to eat Bertha?’
‘Yes, of course,’
answered the young man.
‘Bertha tried to run away
but she couldn’t run fast
because the medals were so heavy.
The wolf caught her easily
and he ate everything,
every bit of Bertha,
except her three medals.’
‘That’s a terrible story,’
said the aunt.
‘No it isn’t,’ shouted the children.
‘It’s the best story ever!’
‘Ah,’ said the young man,
‘the train’s stopping.
It’s my station.’
