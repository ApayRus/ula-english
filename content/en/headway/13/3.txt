Tapescript 13.3
It was about 2 o’clock in the morning,
and …
suddenly I woke up.
I heard a noise.
I got out of bed
and went slowly downstairs.
There was a light on in the living room.
I listened carefully.
I could hear two men speaking very quietly.
‘Burglars!’ I thought.
‘Two burglars!’
Immediately
I ran back upstairs
and phoned the police.
I was really frightened.
Fortunately
the police arrived quickly.
They opened the front door
and went into the living room.
Then they came upstairs to find me.
‘It’s all right now, sir,’
they explained.
‘We turned the television off for you!’
