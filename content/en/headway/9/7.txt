My favourite food
Marian
Well, I love vegetables,
all vegetables –
I eat meat too –
but not much.
I think this is why I like Chinese food so much.
There are lots of vegetables in Chinese food.
Yes, Chinese is my very favourite food,
I like the noodles too.
Can you eat with chopsticks?
I can!
Graham
Now in my job,
I travel the world, and I like all kinds of food …
but my favourite,
my favourite is … er …
I always have it as soon as I come home …
is a full English breakfast.
Bacon,
eggs,
sausage,
mushrooms,
tomatoes, and of course
toast. I love it, not every day but when I’m at home we have it every Sunday.
Mmmm!
I’d like it right now –
delicious.
Lucy
Oh, no question,
no problem.
I know exactly what my favourite food is.
Pasta.
All pasta.
Especially spaghetti.
Pasta with tomato sauce –
and I like it best when I’m in Italy.
I went on holiday to the Italian lakes last year.
The food was wonderful.
Gavin
… er …
I’m not sure.
No, I know what it is.
My … favourite … food is Indian food.
Friday night I like to go to the pub with friends from work and …
have a few beers,
… er …
no,
not too many, …
and after
we always go to an Indian restaurant
and I have a chicken curry with rice.
It’s the best!
I like it more than chips!
Sally
Well, shhh!
But my very,
very favourite food is chocolate.
Chocolate anything,
I love it.
Chocolate ice-cream,
chocolate biscuits,
chocolate cake,
but especially just a big bar of chocolate.
Mmmm!
Terrible, isn’t it?
Go on!
Have some of this!
My friend brought it back from Switzerland for me!
