<v D> I don’t like tea.
<v T> Oh, I do.
Well, sometimes, with sugar.
But coffee’s horrible!
<v D> Yeah. Disgusting.
I don’t like wine or beer either.
<v T> Well –
I don’t like wine but I like beer.
My dad has beer every day after work
and sometimes I have a bit.
<v D> Beer! Yuk!
But apple juice is nice.
I really like apple juice. It’s delicious.
<v T> Mmmm! Yeah, it’s delicious and it’s good for you.
Apples are too!
I love all fruit –
apples, oranges,
bananas, strawberries.
<v D> Yeah. OK.
I like fruit,
but I hate all vegetables,
‘specially carrots.
<v T> Yeah, vegetables are disgusting.
Eh – but not all of them, –
I quite like peas.
Hamburgers, chips, and peas.
Mmm! That’s one of my favourite meals.
<v D> Yeah – hamburgers, I like.
Chips, I like.
But peas – yuk!
<v T> My very favourite meal is spaghetti.
Spaghetti, then ice-cream after.
Yummy! …
Or yoghurt.
I love strawberry yoghurt.
<v D> Ice-cream –
OK, yes.
Yoghurt, no!
Spaghetti – yes.
I like all pasta and pizza!
But I don’t like it with tomatoes or cheese.
I don’t like tomatoes very much and I hate cheese.
<v T> Mmmm! Pizza. The best.
But …
you can’t have pizza without tomatoes and cheese.
<v D> You can. T You can’t! D Can! T Can’t! D Well, I can.
I don’t like cheese at all!
<v T> What do you like then?
<v D> Well, I like …
er …
I like chocolate and chocolate biscuits …

Everybody likes chocolate. Yeah!
