<v MP> Good morning. Can I help you?
<v B> Yes. I’d like some orange juice, please.
<v MP> Er … sorry. There’s apple juice but no orange juice.
<v B> What’s that then?
Isn’t that orange juice?
<v MP> Oh, yes. So it is!
My eyes!
Here you are.
<v B> Thank you, and some milk, please.
<v MP> Sorry. I sold the last bottle two minutes ago.
<v B> Oh, dear! What about some coffee?
<v MP> Yes. Here you are.
<v B> Thanks.
That’s orange juice, coffee
… er …
and … er …
a kilo of apples, please.
<v MP> I don’t sell apples.
<v B> You don’t sell apples! That’s strange.
What about cheese. Can I have some cheese?
<v MP> I don’t sell cheese, either.
<v B> You don’t sell cheese! That’s amazing.
Now, I want some pizza, but I’m sure you don’t sell pizza, do you?
<v MP> Oh, yes I do.
What would you like?
Pizza with mushrooms,
pizza with cheese and ham,
pizza with sausage, or pizza with tomatoes?
<v B> Wow! Can I have … er … some pizza with cheese and tomatoes, please?
<v MP> Oh, sorry. I forgot.
Usually, I have pizza but not on Thursdays. Today’s Thursday, isn’t it?
<v B> Yes, it is. Mmm … OK, … er …
OK, forget the pizza.
What about bread?
I don’t suppose you have any bread?
<v MP> Yes, you’re right.
<v B> Pardon?
<v MP> You’re right.
There isn’t any bread.
<v B> Tell me.
Do you do a lot of business?
<v MP> Oh, yes sir.
This shop is open 24 hours.
<v B> Really!
What do people buy?
<v MP> All the things you see.
<v B> Mmmm. OK. That’s all for me. How much?
<v MP> That’s ?5.60, please.
<v B> Thank you. Goodbye.

See you again soon.
<v B> I don’t think so.
