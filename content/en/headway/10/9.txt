3.58	6.01	Well, I drove out of the garage,
6.25	7.41	along the road,
7.52	8.71	and under the bridge.
9.38	11.20	Then I drove past the pub,
11.46	12.39	up the hill,
12.63	13.74	and down the hill.
14.24	16.39	But then I drove over the river,
16.64	17.23	and then –
18.03	19.15	it was terrible –
19.41	21.05	I went through the hedge,
21.10	22.36	and into the lake!
