Tapescript 10.3
<v Tara> Why did you leave London?
You had a good job.
<v Mel> Yes, but I’ve got a better job here.
<v Tara> And you had a big flat in London.
<v Mel> Well, I’ve got a bigger flat here.
<v Tara> Really? How many bedrooms has it got?
<v Mel> Three.
And it’s got a garden.
It’s nicer than my flat in London
and it’s cheaper.
<v Tara> But you haven’t got any friends!
<v Mel> I’ve got a lot of friends here.
People are much friendlier than in London.
<v Tara> But the country’s so boring.
<v Mel> No, it isn’t.
It’s much more exciting than London.
Seacombe has got shops,
a cinema,
a theatre, and a park.
And the air is cleaner and the streets are safer.
<v Tara> OK. Everything is wonderful!
So when can I visit you?
