Tapescript 14.3
Yes, I’ve lived in a foreign country.
In Japan, actually.
I lived in Osaka for a year.
I enjoyed it very much.
I loved the food.
And, yes,
I have worked for a big company.
I worked for Nissan,
the car company,
that’s why I was in Japan.
That was two years ago,
then I got another job.
Have I stayed in an expensive hotel?
No, never –
only cheap hotels for me, I’m afraid,
but I have flown in a jumbo jet –
four or five times, actually.
Oh,
I’ve never cooked a meal for a lot of people.
I love food but
I don’t like cooking,
sometimes I cook for me and my girlfriend
but she likes it better if we go out for a meal!
And I’ve never met a famous person –
oh,
just a minute,
well not met but I’ve seen … er…
I saw a famous politician
at the airport once –
Oh, who was it?
I can’t remember his name.
Er …
I’ve only seen one Shakespeare play,
when I was at school,
we saw Romeo and Juliet.
It was OK.
I’ve driven a tractor though,
I had a holiday job on a farm when I was 17.
I enjoyed that.
Good news –
I’ve never been to hospital.
I was born in hospital, of course,
but that’s different.
Bad news –
I’ve never won a competition.
I do the lottery every week
but I’ve never,
ever won a thing!
