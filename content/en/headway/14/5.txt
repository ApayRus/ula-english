Tapescript 14.5
Leaving on a jet plane
All my bags are packed,
I’m ready to go
I’m standing here outside your door,
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, It’s early morn’
The taxi’s waiting, He’s blowing his horn.
Already I’m so lonesome
I could die.
So kiss me
and smile for me,
Tell me that you’ll wait for me,
Hold me like you’ll never let me go,
’Cos I’m leaving on a jet plane,
I don’t know when I’ll be back again.
Oh babe, I hate to go.
There’s so many times I’ve let you down,
So many times I’ve played around,
I tell you now They don’t mean a thing.
Every place I go, I’ll think of you
Every song I sing, I’ll sing for you
When I come back I’ll wear your wedding ring.
So kiss me
and smile for me,
Tell me that you’ll wait for me,
Hold me like you’ll never let me go,
’Cos I’m leaving on a jet plane,
I don’t know when I’ll be back again.
Oh babe, I hate to go.
’Cos I’m leaving on a jet plane,
I don’t know when I’ll be back again.
Oh babe, I hate to go.
I hate to go
