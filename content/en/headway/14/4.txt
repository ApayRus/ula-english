Tapescript 14.4
<v M> We’re having a great time!
<v J> Tell me about it!
What have you done so far?
<v M> Well, we’ve been to Buckingham Palace.
That was the first thing we did.
It’s right in the centre of London! We went inside and looked around.
<v J> Have you seen the Houses of Parliament yet?
<v M> Yeah, we have.
We’ve just had a boat ride on the River Thames
and we went right past the Houses of Parliament.
We saw Big Ben!
Then we went on the London Eye. That’s the big wheel
near Big Ben.
That was this morning.
This afternoon
we’re going to take a taxi to Hyde Park
and then go shopping in Harrods.
Tomorrow morning
we’re going to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.
<v J> Wow! You’re busy!
And what about those big red buses?
Have you travelled on a double-decker bus yet?
<v M> Oh, yeah we took one when we went to Buckingham Palace.
We sat upstairs. You get a great view of the city.
<v J> Tomorrow’s your last night.
What are you going to do on your last night?
<v M> Well, we’re going to the theatre, but
we haven’t decided what to see yet.
<v J> Oh, you’re so lucky!
Give my love to Rod!
<v M> Yeah. Bye, Judy. See you soon!
