T 6.4
Well, there are a lot of things I can’t do.
I can’t drive a car,
but I want to have lessons soon.
I can’t speak French
but I can speak Italian,
my mother’s Italian,
and we often go to Italy.
My mother’s a really good cook,
she can cook really well,
not just Italian food,
all kinds of food,
but I can’t cook at all.
I just love eating!
What about sports?
Er … I think I’m good at quite a lot of sports.
I can play tennis,
and ski,
sometimes we go skiing in the Italian Alps,
and of course I can swim.
But musical instruments –
no – I can’t play any at all –
no I’m not very musical,
but I love dancing!
Of course I can use a computer –
all my friends can.
