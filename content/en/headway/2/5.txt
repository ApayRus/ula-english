T 2.5
Dear Miguel,
How are you?
I’m fine.
Here’s a letter in English.
It’s good practice for you and me!
I have classes in English at La Guardia Community College.
I’m in a class with eight students.
They’re all from different countries:
Japan, Brazil, Switzerland,
Poland, and Italy.
Our teacher’s name is Isabel.
She’s very nice
and a very good teacher.
I live in an apartment with two American girls,
Annie and Marnie Kass.
They are sisters.
Annie’s twenty years old
and a dancer.
Marnie’s eighteen
and a student.
They’re very friendly, but it isn’t easy to understand them.
They speak very fast!
New York is very big,
very exciting but very expensive!
The subway
isn’t difficult to use
and it’s cheap.
It’s very cold now
but Central Park is lovely in the snow.
I’m very happy here.
Write to me soon.
Love,
Dorita
