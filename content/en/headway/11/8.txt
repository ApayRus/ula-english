Tapescript 11.8
<v SA> Can I help you?
<v C> Yes, please.
I’m looking for a shirt to go with my new suit.
<v SA> What colour are you looking for?
<v C> Blue.
<v SA> What about this one?
Do you like this?
<v C> No, it isn’t the right blue.
<v SA> Well, what about this one?
It’s a bit darker blue.
<v C> Oh yes.
I like that one much better.
Can I try it on?
<v SA> Yes, of course.
The changing rooms are over there.
Is the size OK?
<v C> No, it’s a bit too big.
Have you got a smaller size?
<v SA> That’s the last blue one we’ve got, I’m afraid.
But we’ve got it in white.
<v C> OK.
I’ll take the white.
How much is it?
<v SA> ?39.99.
How do you want to pay?
<v C> Can I pay by credit card?
<v SA> Credit card’s fine.
Thank you very much.
