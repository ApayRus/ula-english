Tapescript 11.5
What a wonderful world
I see trees of green
Red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
what a wonderful world.
I see skies of blue
and clouds of white
the bright sunny day
and the dark starry night
and I think to myself
what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow
so pretty in the sky
are also on the faces
of the people going by.
I see friends shaking hands
saying ‘How do you do?’
They’re really saying
‘I love you.’
I hear babies cry
I watch them grow.
They’ll learn much more
than you’ll ever know
and I think to myself
what a wonderful world.
Yes, I think to myself
what a wonderful world.
