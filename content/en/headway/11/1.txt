<v O> Oh dear! Monica,
I don’t know any of these people.
Who are they?
<v M> Don’t worry Oliver.
They’re all very nice.
Can you see that man over there?
He’s sitting down.
That’s Harry.
He’s a musician. He works in LA.
<v O> Sorry, where?
<v M> You know, LA. Los Angeles.
<v O> Oh yeah.
<v M> And he’s talking to Mandy.
She’s wearing a red dress.
She’s very nice and very rich!
She lives in a beautiful old house in the country.
<v O> Rich, eh?
<v M> Yes. Rich and married!
Next to her is Fiona.
She’s drinking a glass of red wine.
Fiona’s my oldest friend,
she and I were at school together.
<v O> And what does Fiona do?
<v M> She’s a writer.
She writes children’s stories –
they’re not very good but …
anyway,
she’s talking to George.
He’s laughing and smoking a cigar.
He’s a pilot.
He travels the world, thousands of miles every week.
<v O> And who are those two over there? They’re dancing.
Mmmm. They know each other very well.
<v M> Oh, that’s Roz and Sam. They’re married.
They live in the flat upstairs.
<v O> So … er … that’s Harry and Mandy and … er
… it’s no good, I can’t remember all those names.
