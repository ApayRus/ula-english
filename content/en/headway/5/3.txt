<v Helen> And, this is the kitchen.
<v Bob> Mmm, it’s very nice.
<v Helen> Well,
it’s not very big,
but there are a lot of cupboards.
And there’s a new fridge, and a cooker.
That’s new, too.
<v Bob> But what’s in all these cupboards?
<v Helen> Well, not a lot.
There are some cups, but there aren’t any plates.
And I have some knives and forks,
but I don’t have any spoons!
<v Bob> Do you have any glasses?
<v Helen> No. Sorry.
<v Bob> Never mind.
We can drink this champagne from those cups!
Cheers!
