Tapescript 5.4
What’s in my briefcase?
Well, there’s a newspaper –
a French newspaper –
and there’s a dictionary –
my French/English dictionary.
I have some pens,
three I think.
Also I have a notebook for vocabulary,
I write words in that every day.
And of course I have my keys,
my car keys and my house keys.
Oh yes,
very important,
there are some photos of my family,
my wife and my daughter
and there’s my mobile phone.
I ring my home in Paris every night.
That’s all I think.
I don’t have any stamps and my address book is in my hotel.
