Tapescript 5.2
There are three people in the living room.
A man and a woman on the sofa
and a little girl in the armchair.
There’s a radio on the coffee table
and a rug under it.
There’s a cat on the rug in front of the fire.
There are a lot of pictures on the walls
but there aren’t any photographs.
There are two plants on the floor next to the television
and some flowers on the small table
next to the sofa.
