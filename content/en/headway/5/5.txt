Tapescript 5.5
1
Manola from Lisbon
I live in the old town near the sea.
It is called the Alfama.
I have a very beautiful flat.
There’s just one room in my flat,
one very big room with one very big window.
My bed’s next to the window
so I see the sea
and all the lights of the city when I go to sleep.
I live alone,
but I have a cat
and I’m near the shops
and lots of friends come to visit me.
I love my flat.

Ray and Elsie from Toronto
Elsie Our house is quite old, about fifty years old.
It’s quite near to the city centre.
We have a living room,
quite a big kitchen
and three bedrooms,
but the room we all love is our family room.
Ray Yes, there’s a TV and a stereo
and a large comfortable sofa in there,
and some big, old armchairs.
We love sitting there in winter with the snow outside.
Elsie Our children aren’t at home now,
they both have jobs in the USA,
so most of the time it’s just Ray and me.

Brad from Malibu
My house is fantastic.
It’s right next to the sea.
My neighbours are very rich.
Some of them are famous film stars.
In my house there are ten rooms,
five are bedrooms,
and everything is white,
the floors, the walls,
the sofas,
everything.
I also have a swimming pool,
a cinema
and an exercise room.
I live here alone.
I’m not married at the moment.
My ex-wife is French.
She lives in Paris now with our three sons.

Alise from Samoa
I live with my family in a house near the sea.
We have an open house,
… er … that is … er …
our house
doesn’t have any walls.
Houses in Samoa
don’t have walls because it is very, very hot,
but we have blinds to stop the rain and sun.
Our house is in the old style.
We have only one room for living and sleeping,
so it is both a bedroom
and a living room.
We have rugs
and we sit and sleep on the floor.
