Unit 4
Tapescript 4.1
My weekends are fast and exciting.
My weekdays are fast and domestic!
I have two sons,
Dylan 7,
and Dakota 5.
Every morning I get up one hour before them, at 6.00,
and I go to the gym.
I come home
and I make breakfast
then I take them to school.
On Mondays
I always go shopping.
I buy all the food for the week.
I often cook dinner in the evenings,
but not every day because I donâ€™t like cooking.
Fortunately my husband, Don,
loves cooking.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays
I visit my father.
He lives on the next block.
Every afternoon
I pick up the kids from school.
In the evenings
Don and I usually relax,
but sometimes we visit friends.
We never go out on Friday evenings
because I start work so early on Saturdays.
