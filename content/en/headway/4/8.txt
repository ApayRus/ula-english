Yellow is the color of my true love"s hair
In the morning,
when we rise
In the morning,
when we rise
That"s the time,
That"s the time
I love the best
Green is the color of the sparkling corn
In the morning,
when we rise
In the morning,
when we rise
That"s the time
That"s the time
I love the best
Mellow is the feeling that I get
When I see her,
When I see her,
That"s the time,
That"s the time
I love the best
Freedom is a word
I rarely use
Without thinking,
Without thinking,
Of the time,
Of the time
When I"ve been loved
