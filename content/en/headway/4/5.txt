Tapescript 4.5

Al Wheeler from Canada
We have long, cold winters and short, hot summers.
We have a holiday home near a lake,
so in summer
I go sailing a lot
and I play baseball,
but in winter
I often play ice hockey and go ice-skating.
My favourite season is autumn,
or fall,
as we say in North America.
I love the colours of the trees –
red,
gold,
orange,
yellow, and brown.

Manuela da Silva
from Portugal
People think it’s always warm and sunny in Portugal,
but January and February are often cold, wet, and grey.
I don’t like winter.
I usually meet friends in
restaurant and bars
and we chat.
Sometimes we go to a Brazilian bar.
I love Brazilian music.
But then suddenly it’s summer
and at weekends
we drive to the beach,
sunbathe, and go swimming.
I love summer.

Toshi Suzuki
from Japan
I work for Pentax cameras,
in the export department.
I don’t have a lot of free time,
but I have one special hobby –
taking photographs,
of course!
I like taking photographs of
flowers,
especially in spring.
Sometimes, after work,
I relax in a bar near my office with friends.
My friend,
Shigeru,
likes singing pop songs in the bar.
This has a special name,
karaoke.
I don’t sing –
I’m too shy!
