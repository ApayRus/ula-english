Tapescript 8.6
Love on the Internet –
Debbie and Per
<v Debbie> I’m really quite shy.
I find it difficult to talk to people face to face.
But I find it easy to chat on the Internet.
I met Per there about a year ago.
It was on a chatline called ‘the Chat Room’.
He was so funny.
<v Per> But I’m only funny on the Internet!
Anyway, we ‘chatted’ on the Internet for a year,
we exchanged hundreds of e-mails and some photographs.
I wanted to phone Debbie but …
<v Debbie> I said no.
I was worried.
I didn’t want it to end.
<v Per> She didn’t even give me her address.
But finally she said OK, I could phone,
so I did, and we spoke for an hour.
It was very expensive!
That was six months ago.
Then she sent me her address and …
<v Debbie>… that was three months ago
and one week later,
there was a knock at the door
and I knew before I opened it.
Somehow I wasn’t worried any more.
I opened the door and …
<v Per>… and I stood there with some flowers …
<v Debbie>… lots of flowers.
Red roses. Beautiful … and …
<v Both> and well, we fell in love and … and we got married last Saturday.
Love in a bottle –
Rosa and Vincent
<v Rosa> I love the sea.
I like walking on the beach.
One day,
it was five years ago now,
I was on the beach and I stood on something,
it was a bottle,
a green bottle.
I could see something inside.
Some paper,
so I broke the bottle,
it was a letter but …
<v Vincent>… but you couldn’t read it …
<v Rosa> No, I couldn’t.
You see it was in English and I couldn’t speak English then.
<v Vincent> You can speak it well now …
<v Rosa> Now, not realy.
but anyway.
I asked a friend to translate the letter for me.
We couldn’t believe it.
A man in America –
he wanted a wife,
but the letter was ten years old.
<v Vincent> And I still wasn’t married!
<v Rosa> But I didn’t know that.
Anyway for a joke I wrote and sent a photo …
<v Vincent> And now, I couldn’t believe it.
I got this letter and a photo.
She looked beautiful.
I wrote back immediately
and we wrote every week for six months …
and we spoke on the phone and …
<v Rosa>… and finally
I flew to America and we met face to face.
I was very shy but it was good,
very good and now …
<v Vincent>… now, we have three children.
We have a house by the sea …
<v Rosa> We’re very happy. You see,
we both love the sea!
