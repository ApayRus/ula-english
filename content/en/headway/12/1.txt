Rosie
When I grow up
I’m going to be a ballet dancer.
I love dancing.
I go dancing three times a week.
I’m going to travel all over the world and I’m going to learn French
and Russian
because I want to dance in Paris and Moscow.
I’m not going to marry until I’m thirty-five
and then I’m going to have two children.
First I’d like a girl and then a boy –
but maybe I can’t plan that!
I’m going to work until I’m 75.
I’m going to teach dancing
and I’m going to open a dance school.
It’s all very exciting.
Miss Bishop
When I retire … ?
… er …
well …
er …
two things.
First,
I’m going to learn Russian –
I can already speak French and German,
and I want to learn another language.
And second,
I’m going to learn to drive.
It’s terrible that I’m 59 and I can’t drive –
no time to learn.
Then I’m going to buy a car
and travel all over the world.
Also
I’m not going to wear boring clothes any more,
I hate the skirts and blouses I wear every day for school.
I’m going to wear jeans and T-shirts
all the time.
And when I return from my travels
I’m going to write a book
and go on TV to talk about it.
I’m going to become a TV star!
