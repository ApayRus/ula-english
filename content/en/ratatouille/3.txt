Now, don't you feel better, Remy?<br />You've helped a noble cause.
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.
And what we're stealing is,<br />let's face it, garbage.
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.
If no one wants it,<br />why are we stealing it?
Let's just say<br />we have different points of view.
This much I knew:
If you are what you eat,<br />then I only want to eat the good stuff.
But to my dad...
Food is fuel.
You get picky about what you put<br />in the tank, your engine is going to die.
Now shut up and eat your garbage.
Look, if we're going to be thieves,
why not steal the good stuff<br />in the kitchen,
where nothing is poisoned?
First of all, we are not thieves.
Secondly, stay out of the kitchen<br />and away from the humans.
It's dangerous.
