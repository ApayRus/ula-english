Colette, wait! Colette.
- You came back. Colette...<br />- Don't say a word.
If I think about it,<br />I might change my mind.
Just tell me what the rat wants to cook.
Ratatouille? It's a peasant dish.
Are you sure<br />you want to serve this to Ego?
What? I am making ratatouille.<br />Well, how would you prepare it?
Ratatouille? They must be joking.
No, it can't be.
Who cooked the ratatouille?<br />I demand to know!
I can't remember the last time
I asked a waiter<br />to give my compliments to the chef.
And now I find myself<br />in the extraordinary position
of having my waiter be the chef.
Thanks, but I'm just your waiter tonight.
Then who do I thank for the meal?
Excuse me a minute.
You must be the chef...
If you wish to meet the chef,<br />you will have to wait
until all the other customer have gone.
So be it.
