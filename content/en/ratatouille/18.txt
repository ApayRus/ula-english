That should do it.
Congratulations. You were able to<br />repeat your accidental success.
But you'll need to know more than soup<br />if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.
Colette will be responsible for<br />teaching you how we do things here.
Listen, I just want you to know
how honored I am<br />to be studying under such...
No! You listen. I just want you to know<br />exactly who you are dealing with.
How many women<br />do you see in this kitchen?
Well, I...
- Only me. Why do you think that is?<br />- Well, I...
Because haute cuisine<br />is an antiquated hierarchy
built upon rules<br />written by stupid old men.
Rules designed to make it impossible<br />for women to enter this world.
But still I'm here. How did this happen?
Because, well, because you...
Because I am the toughest cook<br />in this kitchen.
I've worked too hard<br />for too long to get here
and I am not going to jeopardize it<br />for some garbage boy who got lucky.
Got it?
Wow!
