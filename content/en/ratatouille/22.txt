Have you decided this evening?
- Your soup is excellent. But...<br />- But we order it every time.
- What else do you have?<br />- Well, we have a very nice foie gras.
I know about the foie gras.
The old standby,<br />used to be famous for it.
What does the chef have that's new?
- Someone has asked what is new!<br />- New?
Yes. What do I tell them?
- Well, what did you tell them?<br />- I told them I would ask!
What are you blathering about?
- Customers are asking what is new.<br />- What should I tell them?
- What did you tell them?<br />- I told them I would ask!
This is simple.
Just pull out an old Gusteau recipe,
something we haven't made<br />in a while...
They know about the old stuff.<br />They like Linguini's soup.
They are asking for food from Linguini?
A lot of customers like the soup.<br />That's all we are saying.
Were we saying that?
Very well. If it's Linguini they want
tell them Chef Linguini has prepared<br />something special for them.
Something definitely off menu.
Oh, and don't forget to stress
- its Linguini-ness.<br />- Qui, chef.
Now is your chance to try something<br />worthy of your talent, Linguini.
A forgotten favorite of the chefs,<br />sweetbread a la Gusteau.
- Colette will help you.<br />- Qui, chef.
Now, hurry up. Our diners are hungry.
Are you sure?<br />That recipe was a disaster.
Gusteau himself said so.
Just the sort of challenge<br />a budding chef needs.
"Sweetbread a la Gusteau.
"Sweetbread cooked<br />in a seaweed salt crust
"with cuttlefish tentacle,<br />dog rose puree,
"geoduck egg, dried white fungus?
"Anchovy licorice sauce. "
I don't know this recipe,<br />but it's Gusteau's, so...
Lalo! We have<br />some veal stomach soaking, yes?
Yes! The veal stomach, I get that.
Veal stomach?
Okay.
I'll be right back. Where...
Hey, I got to...
Don't mind me.<br />I just need to borrow this real quick.
Let's see, over here...
I'll be back.
Thank you.
Excuse me. I'm going to...
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...
I'm going to pick that up.
I got some of that spice.
Okay.
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.
This is the recipe.
The recipe doesn't call<br />for white truffle oil!
What else have you...<br />You are improvising?
This is no time to experiment.<br />The customer are waiting.
You're right. I should listen to you!
- Stop that!<br />- Stop what?
Freaking me out!<br />Whatever you are doing, stop it.
- Where is the special order?<br />- Coming!
- I thought we were together on this.<br />- We are together.
- Then what are you doing?<br />- It's very hard to explain.
- The special?<br />- Come get it!
Whoa, whoa.<br />I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.
- Don't you dare.<br />- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...
Sorry.
Is Linguini's dish done yet?
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.<br />Just went out.
- Did you taste it?<br />- Ja, of course, before he changed it.
Good. What? How could he change it?
He changed it<br />as it was going out the door!
They love it!
Other diners are already<br />asking about it, about Linguini.
I have seven more orders!
That's wonderful.
I'd like one of those.
Special order!
What is that?
Special order! Special order!<br />Special order!
To Linguini.
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.<br />- Cheers, ja?
Drink now, there's plenty.
