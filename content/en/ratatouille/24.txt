- Remy!<br />- Emile?
I can't believe it! You're alive!
- You made it!<br />- I thought I'd never see you guys again!
We figured<br />you didn't survive the rapids.
And what are you eating?
I don't really know.
I think it was<br />some sort of wrapper once.
What? No.<br />You're in Paris now, baby. My town.
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta<br />in my town.
Remy! You are stealing?<br />You told Linguini he could trust you.
- And he can. It's for my brother.<br />- But the boy could lose his job.
Which means I would, too.<br />It's under control, okay?
- More wine?<br />- I shouldn't, but... Okay.
So, where did you train, Linguini?
Train? All right.
Surely you don't expect me to believe<br />this is your first time cooking?
- It's not.<br />- I knew it!
It's my... Second, third, fourth...<br />Fifth time.
Monday was my first time.
But I've taken out the garbage<br />lots of times before that...
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.
- Do you like animals?<br />- What? Animals? What kind?
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,<br />guinea pigs,
rats.
I brought you something to...<br />No, no, no, no!
Spit that out right now!
I have got to teach you about food.<br />Close your eyes.
Now take a bite of... No! No! No!
- Don't just hork it down!<br />- Too late.
Here.
Chew it slowly.<br />Only think about the taste.
- See?<br />- Not really.
Creamy, salty sweet,<br />an oaky nuttiness.
- You detect that?<br />- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.
Close your eyes. Now taste this.
Whole different thing, right?<br />Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.
- Okay.<br />- Now, try them together.
Okay.
I think I'm getting<br />a little something there.
- It might be the nuttiness.<br />- See?
- Could be the tang.<br />- That's it.
Now, imagine every great taste<br />in the world
being combined<br />into infinite combinations.
Tastes that no one has tried yet!<br />Discoveries to be made!
I think...
- You lost me again.<br />- Yeah.
But that was interesting.
Most interesting garbage I ever...<br />What are we doing?
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!
We've got to go to the colony!<br />Everyone will be thrilled!
- Yeah! But...<br />- What?
Thing is, I kind of have to...
What do you "have to"<br />more than family?
What's more important here?
Well, I...
It wouldn't hurt to visit.
