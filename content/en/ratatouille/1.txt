Although each of the world's countries<br />would like to dispute this fact,
we French know the truth:
The best food in the world<br />is made in France.
The best food in France<br />is made in Paris.
And the best food in Paris, some say,<br />is made by Chef Auguste Gusteau.
Gusteau's restaurant<br />is the toast of Paris,
booked five months in advance.
And his dazzling ascent<br />to the top of fine French cuisine
has made his competitors envious.
He is the youngest chef ever<br />to achieve a five-star rating.
Chef Gusteau's cookbook,<br />Anyone Can Cook!
climbed to the top of the bestseller list.
But not everyone<br />celebrates Its success.
Amusing title, Anyone Can Cook!
What's even more amusing is that<br />Gusteau actually seems to believe it.
I, on the other hand,<br />take cooking seriously.
And, no, I don't think anyone can do it.
