Easy to cook. Easy to eat.<br />Gusteau makes Chinese food
Chine-easy.
- Excellent work, Frangois, as usual.<br />- It's good, isn't it?
I want you to work up something<br />for my latest frozen food concept.
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.<br />Bite size.
What are corn dogs?
Cheap sausages dipped in batter<br />and deep fried. You know, American.
Whip something up.
Maybe Gusteau in overalls<br />and Huckleberry Tom hat.
Or as a big ear of corn<br />in doggie make-up.
Yes. But, please, with dignity.
Get my lawyer!
