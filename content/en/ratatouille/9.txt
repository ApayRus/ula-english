I waited
for a sound,
a voice,
a sign,
something.
If you are hungry,<br />go up and look around, Remy.
Why do you wait and mope?
Well, I've just lost my family,<br />all my friends,
probably forever.
- How do you know?<br />- Well, I...
You are an illustration.<br />Why am I talking to you?
Well, you just lost your family,<br />all your friends. You are lonely.
Yeah. Well, you're dead.
Ah, but that is no match<br />for wishful thinking.
If you focus on what you've left behind,
you'll never be able to see<br />what lies ahead.
Now go up and look around.
