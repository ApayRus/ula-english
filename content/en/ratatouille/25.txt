- Have you had a pet rat?<br />- No.
- Did you work in a lab with rats?<br />- No.
Perhaps you lived in squalor<br />at some point?
Nopety nopety no.
You know something about rats!<br />You know you do!
You know who know do whacka-doo.<br />Ratta-tatta.
- Hey! Why do they call it that?<br />- What?
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?<br />Why do they call it that?
If you're going to name a food,
you should give it a name<br />that sounds delicious.
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.<br />It sounds like "rat" and "patootie. "
Rat patootie.<br />Which does not sound delicious.
Regrettably we are all out of wine.
My son has returned!
And finding someone to replace you<br />for poison checker has been a disaster.
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,<br />but it hasn't been easy.
- You didn't make it easy.<br />- I know. I am sorry, Dad.
Well, the important thing<br />is that you're home.
- Yeah, well, about that...<br />- You look thin. Why is that?
A shortage of food,<br />or a surplus of snobbery?
It's tough out there in the big world<br />all alone, isn't it?
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?<br />- I can take care of myself.
I've found a nice spot not far away,<br />so I'll be able to visit often.
Nothing like a cold splash of reality<br />to make you...
- Visit?<br />- I will. I promise. Often.
- You're not staying?<br />- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...
You didn't think<br />I was going to stay forever, did you?
Eventually,<br />a bird's got to leave the nest.
We're not birds. We're rats.
We don't leave our nests.<br />We make them bigger.
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.<br />- Maybe you're not a rat at all.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Hey! The band's<br />really on tonight, huh?
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.
I'm tired of taking.<br />I want to make things.
I want to add something to this world.
- You're talking like a human.<br />- Who are not as bad as you say.
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?<br />- Oh, man.
I've been able to observe them<br />at a close-ish sort of range.
- Yeah? How close?<br />- Close enough.
And they're, you know,<br />not so bad as you say they are.
Come with me.<br />I got something I want you to see.
You know, I'm going to stay here.
