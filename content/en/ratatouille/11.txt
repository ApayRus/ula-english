Hey, boss, look who is here.
Alfredo Linguini, Renata's little boy.
- Hi.<br />- All grown up, eh?
You remember Renata,<br />Gusteau's old flame?
- Yes. How are you...<br />- Linguini.
Yes, Linguini. So nice of you to visit.<br />How is...
- My mother?<br />- Renata.
- Yes, Renata. How is she?<br />- Good.
Well, not... She's been better. I mean...
She died.
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be. She believed in heaven,<br />so she's covered.
You know, afterlife-wise?

Chef de partie, demi chef de partie,<br />both important.

You are a clever rat. Now, who is that?
Oh, him? He's nobody.
Not nobody. He is part of the kitchen.
No, he's a plongeur or something.
He washes dishes or takes out<br />the garbage. He doesn't cook.
- But he could.<br />- Uh, no.

Well, yeah, anyone can.<br />That doesn't mean that anyone should.
Well, that is not stopping him. See?

What can I do?<br />I am a figment of your imagination.
But he's ruining the soup!<br />We got to tell someone that he's...
