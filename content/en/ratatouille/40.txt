At first, Ego thinks it's a joke.
But as Linguini explains,<br />Ego's smile disappears.
He doesn't react<br />beyond asking an occasional question.
And when the story is done,<br />Ego stands, thanks us for the meal...
Thank you for the meal.
...and leaves without another word.
The following day his review appears.
In many ways,<br />the work of a critic is easy.
We risk very little,<br />yet enjoy a position over those
who offer up their work<br />and their selves to our judgment.
We thrive on negative criticism,<br />which is fun to write and to read.
But the bitter truth we critics must face<br />is that in the grand scheme of things,
the average piece of junk<br />is probably more meaningful
than our criticism designating it so.
But there are times<br />when a critic truly risks something
and that is in the discovery<br />and defense of the new.
The world is often unkind<br />to new talent, new creations.
The new needs friends.
Last night,<br />I experienced something new,
an extraordinary meal<br />from a singularly unexpected source.
To say that both the meal<br />and its maker
have challenged my preconceptions<br />about fine cooking
is a gross understatement.
They have rocked me to my core.
In the past, I have made no secret<br />of my disdain
for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,<br />"Anyone can cook. "
But I realize only now<br />do I truly understand what he meant.
Not everyone<br />can become a great artist,
but a great artist<br />can come from anywhere.
It is difficult to imagine<br />more humble origins
than those of the genius<br />now cooking at Gusteau's,
who is, in this critic's opinion,
nothing less<br />than the finest chef in France.
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon,<br />hungry for more.
