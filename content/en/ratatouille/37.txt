It's your recipe.
How can you not know<br />your own recipe?
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.
Then make it come to you again, ja?<br />Because we can't serve this!
Where's my order?
Can't we serve something else?<br />Something I didn't invent?
This is what they're ordering.
Make them order something else.<br />Tell them we're all out.
We cannot be all out. We just opened.
I have another idea.<br />What if we serve them what they order!
We will make it.<br />Just tell us what you did.
I don't know what I did.
We need to tell<br />the customers something.
Then tell them... Tell them...
- Don't do it.<br />- Remy. Remy.
Don't! Stop! They'll see you. Stop.
We're not talking about me.<br />We're talking about what to do right...
Rats!
- Remy!<br />- Get my knife.
Don't touch him!
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.
I know this sounds insane, but...
Well,<br />the truth sounds insane sometimes.
But that doesn't mean it's not the truth.
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.
But this rat,<br />he's the one behind these recipes.
He's the cook. The real cook.<br />He's been hiding under my toque.
He's been controlling my actions.
He's the reason I can cook the food<br />that's exciting everyone.
The reason Ego is outside that door.
You've been giving me credit<br />for his gift.
I know it's a hard thing to believe.
But, hey, you believed I could cook,<br />right?
Look, this works.<br />It's crazy, but it works.
We can be<br />the greatest restaurant in Paris,
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,<br />can lead us there.
What do you say? You with me?
