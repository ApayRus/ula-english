This is me.
I think it's apparent<br />I need to rethink my life a little bit.
What's my problem?
First of all, I'm a rat.
Which means life is hard.
And second, I have a highly developed<br />sense of taste and smell.
Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...
Oh! Small twist of lemon.
Whoa, you can smell all that?<br />You have a gift.
This is Emile, my brother.<br />He's easily impressed.
So you can smell ingredients?<br />So what?
This is my dad. He's never impressed.
He also happens to be<br />the leader of our clan.
So, what's wrong<br />with having highly developed senses?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't eat that!<br />- What's going on here?
Turns out that funny smell<br />was rat poison.
Suddenly, Dad didn't think<br />my talent was useless.
I was feeling pretty good about my gift,
until Dad gave me a job.
Clean.
Clean.
That's right. Poison checker.
Cleanerific.
Cleanerino.
Close to godliness.
Which means clean.<br />You know, cleanliness is close to...
Never mind. Move on.
Well, it made my dad proud.
