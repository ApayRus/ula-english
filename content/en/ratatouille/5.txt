So now I had a secret life.
The only one who knew about it<br />was Emile.
Hey, Emile. Emile.
I found a mushroom.
Come on, you're good at hiding food.<br />Help me find a good place to put this.
He doesn't understand me,<br />but I can be myself around him.
Why are you walking like that?
I don't want to constantly<br />have to wash my paws.
Did you ever think about how we walk<br />on the same paws
that we handle food with?
You ever think about<br />what we put into our mouths?
All the time.
When I eat, I don't want to taste<br />everywhere my paws have been.
Well, go ahead.
But if Dad sees you walking like that,<br />he's not going to like it.
What have you got there?
You found cheese?
And not just any cheese.<br />Tomme de chevre de pays!
That would go beautifully<br />with my mushroom.
And...
This rosemary! This rosemary
with maybe with a few drops<br />from this sweet grass.
Well, throw it on the pile, I guess,<br />and then we'll... You know...
We don't want to throw this in<br />with the garbage. This is special.
But we're supposed<br />to return to the colony
before sundown or,<br />you know, Dad's gonna...
Emile!
There are possibilities<br />unexplored here.
We got to cook this.
Now, exactly how we cook this<br />is the real...
Yeah.
The key is to keep turning it.
Get the smoky flavor nice and even.
That storm's getting closer.
Hey, Remy, you think that maybe<br />we shouldn't be so...
You got to taste this!
This is... It's got this kind of...<br />It's burny, melty...
It's not really a smoky taste.<br />It's a certain... It's kind of like a...
It's got, like, this "ba-boom, zap"<br />kind of taste. Don't you think?
- What would you call that flavor?<br />- Lightning-y?
Yeah. It's lightning-y!<br />We got to do that again.
Okay, when the next storm comes,<br />we'll go up on the roof...
I know what this needs. Saffron.<br />A little saffron would make this.
Saffron. Why do I get the feeling
- it's in the kitchen?<br />- It's in the kitchen.
