- Saffron.<br />- Not good.
Saffron.
Don't like it. She's going to wake up.
I've been down here a million times.
She turns on the cooking channel,<br />boom, she never wakes up.
You've been here a million times?
I'm telling you, saffron will be<br />just the thing. Gusteau swears by it.
Okay. Who's Gusteau?
Just the greatest chef in the world.<br />Wrote this cookbook.
Wait. You read?
- Well, not excessively.<br />- Oh, man. Does Dad know?
You could fill a book, a lot of books,<br />with things Dad doesn't know.
And they have, which is why I read.<br />Which is also our secret.
I don't like secrets.
All this cooking and reading<br />and TV-watching
while we read and cook.
It's like you're involving me in crime,<br />and I let you.
Why do I let you?
