Dad.
Dad, I don't know what to say.
I was wrong about your friend<br />and about you.
I don't want you to think<br />I'm choosing this over family.
I can't choose<br />between two halves of myself.
I'm not talking about cooking.<br />I'm talking about guts.
This really means that much to you?
We're not cooks, but we are family.
You tell us what to do,<br />and we'll get it done.
- Stop that health inspector!<br />- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!
The rest of you stay and help Remy.
Team three will be handling fish.<br />Team four, roasted items.
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.<br />Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!
Those handling food<br />will walk on two legs.

I'm sorry for any delay,<br />but we're a little short tonight.
Please, take all of the time you need.

Only use the mimolette cheese.
Whoa! Compose the salad<br />like you were painting a picture.
Not too much vinaigrette<br />on that salade composee.
Don't let that beurre blanc separate.<br />Keep whisking.
Gently poach the scallops.<br />Taste check. Spoons down.
Good. Too much salt. Good.
Don't boil the consomme,<br />it'll toughen the pheasant. Emile!
Sorry.
