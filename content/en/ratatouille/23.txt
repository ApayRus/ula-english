Drink now, there's plenty.
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.
We really did it tonight.
Got your toque.
Oh, seriously now.
I'd love to have a little talk with you,<br />Linguini, in my office.
- Am I in trouble?<br />- Trouble? No.
A little wine, a friendly chat.<br />Just us cooks.
The plongeur won't be coming to you<br />for advice anymore, eh, Colette?
He's gotten all he needs.
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?
Good for you.
I just took it to be polite.<br />I don't really drink, you know.
Of course you don't.<br />I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.
But you would have to be an idiot<br />of elephantine proportions
not to appreciate<br />this '61 Chateau Latour.
And you, Monsieur Linguini,<br />are no idiot.
Let us toast your non-idiocy.
