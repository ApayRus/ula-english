I know I'm supposed to hate humans,<br />but there's something about them.
They don't just survive.<br />They discover, they create.
I mean,<br />just look at what they do with food.
How can I describe it?
Good food is like music you can taste,<br />color you can smell.
There is excellence all around you.
You need only be aware to stop<br />and savor it.
Oh, Gusteau was right.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, amazing.
Each flavor was totally unique.
But combine one flavor with another,
and something new was created.
