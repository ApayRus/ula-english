Do you know<br />what you would like this evening, sir?
Yes,<br />I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.
Come in!
Today's the big day.<br />You should say something to them.
- Like what?<br />- You are the boss. Inspire them.
Attention. Attention, everyone.
Tonight is a big night.
Appetite is coming,<br />and he's going to have a big ego.
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.
And he's going to order something.
Something from our menu.
And we'll have to cook it,<br />unless he orders something cold.
Just can't leave it alone, can you?
You really shouldn't be here<br />during restaurant hours. It's not safe.
I'm hungry!
And I don't need the inside food<br />to be happy.
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.
- Observe.<br />- No, wait!
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?<br />- I'll go get Dad.
You might think you are a chef<br />but you are still only a rat.
Sure he took away a star<br />last time he reviewed this place.
Sure it probably killed... Dad.
- This is very bad juju right here.<br />- But I'll tell you one thing...
- Ego is here.<br />- Ego? He is here?
Anton Ego is just another customer.<br />Let's cook!
Yeah! Let's...
Okay.
So I have in mind<br />a simple arrangement.
You will create for me a new line<br />of Chef Skinner frozen foods.
And I, in return, will not kill you.
Au revoir, rat!
Do you know<br />what you would like this evening, sir?
Yes, I think I do.
After reading a lot of overheated<br />puffery about your new cook,
you know what I'm craving?
A little perspective.
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,<br />well seasoned perspective.
Can you suggest<br />a good wine to go with that?
- With what, sir?<br />- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?
I am...
Very well.<br />Since you're all out of perspective
and no one else<br />seems to have it in this bloody town,
I'll make you a deal.
You provide the food,<br />I'll provide the perspective.
Which would go nicely<br />with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.
I'm afraid I...
Your dinner selection?
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want<br />whatever he dares to serve me.
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.
I will have whatever he is having.
