Well, the will stipulates
that if after a period of two years<br />from the date of death
no heir appears,
Gusteau's business interests<br />will pass to his sous chef. You.
I know what the will stipulates.
What I want to know is if this letter...<br />If this boy changes anything!
There's not much resemblance.
There's no resemblance at all.<br />He is not Gusteau's son.
Gusteau had no children,<br />and what of the timing of all this?
The deadline in the will<br />expires in less than a month!
Suddenly,<br />some boy arrives with a letter
from his recently deceased mother<br />claiming Gusteau is his father?
Highly suspect!
- This is Gusteau's?<br />- Yes, yes, yes.
- May I?<br />- Of course.
But the boy does not know.
She claims she never told him,<br />or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.
- Why you? What does she want?<br />- A job for the boy.
- Only a job?<br />- Well, yes.
Then what are you worried about?<br />If he works here,
you'll be able to keep an eye on him<br />while I do a little digging.
Find out how much of this is real.
I will need you<br />to collect some DNA samples
from the boy. Hair, maybe.
Mark my words.<br />The whole thing is highly suspect.
He knows something.
Relax, he's a garbage boy.<br />I think you can handle him.
