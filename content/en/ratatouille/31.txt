Rat!
Disgusting little creatures.
I was reminded how fragile it all was.
How the world really saw me.
And it just kept getting better.
Remy!
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!
We were afraid you weren't going to,<br />you know, show up.
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?<br />- You told them?
Emile,<br />that's exactly what I said not to do!
But you know these guys.<br />They're my friends.
I didn't think you meant them.<br />Look, I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you're sorry,<br />tell them you're sorry.
- Is there a problem over here?<br />- No, there is not.
Wait here.
It's locked?
- Remy, what are you doing in here?<br />- Okay. Emile shows up with...
Okay, I said not to. I told him...<br />He goes and blabs to...
Yeah, it's a disaster.
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe<br />is locked and I need the key.
- They want you to steal food?<br />- Yes. No! It's...
It's complicated. It's family.<br />They don't have your ideals.
Ideals?<br />If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,
you think I'd be hawking barbecue<br />over here?
Or microwave burritos?
Or, Tooth, I say,<br />Tooth Pick'n Chicken?
About as French as a corn dog!
Coming soon!
We're inventing new ways<br />to sell out over here.
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?
I cannot control<br />how they use my image, Remy.
- I am dead!<br />- Can you guys shut up?
I've got to think! Word's getting out.<br />If I can't keep them quiet,
the entire clan's gonna be after me<br />with their mouths open and...
Here it is.
Hey. Your will!
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...<br />- Not at all.
Linguini?
Why would Linguini be filed<br />with your will?
This used to be my office.
He's your son?
- I have a son?<br />- How could you not know this?
I am a figment of your imagination.<br />You did not know, how could I?
Well, your son is the rightful owner<br />of this restaurant!
