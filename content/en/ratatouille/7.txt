What's taking those kids so long?
L'Aquila saffron. Italian. Huh?
Gusteau says it's excellent.<br />Good thing the old lady is a food love...
Forget mystique.<br />This is about your cooking.
Hey! That's Gusteau. Emile, look.
Great cooking<br />is not for the faint of heart.
You must be imaginative,<br />strong hearted.
You must try things that may not work.
And you must not let anyone<br />define your limits
because of where you come from.
Your only limit is your soul.
What I say is true. Anyone can cook.<br />But only the fearless can be great.
Pure poetry.
But it was not to last.
Gusteau's restaurant lost<br />one of its five stars
after a scathing review<br />by France's top food critic, Anton Ego.
It was a severe blow to Gusteau,
and the brokenhearted chef<br />died shortly afterwards,
which, according to tradition,<br />meant the loss of another star.
Gusteau is dead?
Run!
No, you'll lead her to the colony!
- Help, Remy, help!<br />- Emile! Start swinging the light!
Try to grab you.
Emile, swing to me.
Evacuate! Everyone, to the boats.
- Let me through!<br />- The book.
Excuse me. Move, move.
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move.
Get the bridge up! Move it, move it!
Hey, Johnny! Hurry!
Push off. Come on.
Get hold!
- Take the baby. Here!<br />- Give me your paw.
Hey, wait for me!
Is everybody here?<br />Do we have everybody?
- Wait a minute. Where's Remy?<br />- Right here. I'm coming.
I'm coming!
Hold on, Son.<br />Give him something to grab on to.
Come on, boy. Paddle, Son.
Come on. Reach for it.
You can do it.
- Remy!<br />- Dad!
Come on. You can make it.<br />You can make it.
