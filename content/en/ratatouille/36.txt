- So, we have given up.<br />- Why do you say that?
We are in a cage inside the car trunk
awaiting a future<br />in frozen food products.
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.
You are free.
I am only as free<br />as you imagine me to be.
As you are.
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.<br />I pretend to be a rat for my father.
I pretend to be a human<br />through Linguini.
I pretend you exist<br />so I have someone to talk to!
You only tell me stuff I already know!
I know who I am!<br />Why do I need you to tell me?
Why do I need to pretend?
But you don't, Remy.
You never did.
No. My other left!
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!
I'm inside the trunk! What the...
Dad!
- Hey, little brother!<br />- Emile!
I love you guys!
Where are you going?
Back to the restaurant.<br />They'll fail without me.
- Why do you care?<br />- Because I'm a cook!
