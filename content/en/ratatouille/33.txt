Health Inspector.
I wish to report a rat infestation.
It's taken over my...<br />Gusteau's restaurant.
Gusteau's, eh?
I can drop by. Let's see.<br />First opening is three months.
It must happen now!<br />It's a gourmet restaurant!
Monsieur, I have the information.<br />If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.
But the rat! You must...
It stole my documents.
- It's past opening time.<br />- He should have finished an hour ago.
Bonjour, ma cherie.<br />Join us.
We were just talking<br />about my inspiration.
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.
Not that, dearest. I meant you.
- It's him.<br />- Ego?
Anton Ego!
Is that Ego?
I can't believe it.
- You are Monsieur Linguini?<br />- Hello.
Pardon me for interrupting<br />your premature celebration,
but I thought it only fair<br />to give you a sporting chance
as you are new to this game.
- Game?<br />- Yes.
And you've been playing<br />without an opponent.
Which is, as you may have guessed,<br />against the rules.
You're Anton Ego.
You're slow<br />for someone in the fast lane.
And you're thin<br />for someone who likes food.
I don't like food. I love it.
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
I will return tomorrow night<br />with high expectations.
Pray you don't disappoint me.
Listen, we hate to be rude,<br />but we're French, and it's dinnertime.
She meant to say,<br />"It's dinnertime and we're French. "
Don't give me that look.
You were distracting me<br />in front of the press.
How am I supposed to concentrate with<br />you yanking on my hair all the time?
And that's another thing.
Your opinion isn't the only one<br />that matters here.
Colette knows how to cook, too,<br />you know.
All right, that's it!
You take a break, Little Chef.
I'm not your puppet,
and you're not<br />my puppet-controlling guy!
The rat is the cook.
You cool off and get your mind right,<br />Little Chef.
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!
