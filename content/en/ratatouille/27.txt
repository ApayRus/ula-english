Hey! Yeah.
Stop it.
Good morning.
Good morning.
So, the chef,<br />he invited you in for a drink?
That's big.
That's big. What did he say?
What?
What, you can't tell me?
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,<br />personal relationship with the chef.
Oh, I see how it is.
You get me to teach you<br />a few kitchen tricks
to dazzle the boss<br />and then you blow past me?
Wake up. Wake up.
I thought you were different.
I thought you thought I was different.
I thought...
I didn't have to help you!
If I looked out only for myself,<br />I would have let you drown!
But...
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.
My mistake.
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!
It's over, Little Chef.<br />I can't do it anymore.
