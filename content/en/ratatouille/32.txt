No! No! The rat!
- Sorry, chef.<br />- The rat! It's stolen my documents!
- It's getting away!<br />- Hey, Mr. Chef!
- You! Get out of my office.<br />- He's not in your office. You are in his.
Bottoms up, Linguini!
Cheers, ja.
- Chef! Chef!<br />- Chef Linguini!
Your rise has been meteoric,<br />yet you have no formal training.
What is the secret to your genius?
Secret? You want the truth?
I am Gusteau's son.<br />It's in my blood I guess.
But you weren't aware of that fact<br />until very recently.
No.
And it resulted in your<br />taking ownership of this restaurant.
How did you find out?
Well, some part of me just knew.
The Gusteau part?
- Where do you get your inspiration?<br />- Inspiration has many names.
- Mine is named Colette.<br />- What?
Something's stuck in my teeth.
