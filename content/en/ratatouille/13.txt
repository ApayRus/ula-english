The soup! Where is the soup?<br />Out of my way.
Move it, garbage boy!
You are cooking?
How dare you cook in my kitchen?
Where do you get the gall
to even attempt something<br />so monumentally idiotic?
I should have you drawn<br />and quartered!
I'll do it. I think the law is on my side.
Larousse, draw and quarter this man
after you put him in the duck press<br />to squeeze the fat out of his head.
- What are you blathering about?<br />- The soup!
Soup?
Stop that soup!
Waiter.
Linguini!
You're fired!
F- I-R-E-D! Fired!
She wants to see the chef.
But he...
- What did the customer say?<br />- It was not a customer. It was a critic.
- Ego?<br />- Solene LeClaire.
- LeClaire? What did she say?<br />- She likes the soup.
- Wait.<br />- What do you mean, "Wait"?
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
Someone is asking about your soup.
What are you playing at?
Am I still fired?
- You can't fire him.<br />- What?
LeClaire likes it, yeah?<br />She made a point of telling you so.
If she write a review to that effect
and find out you fired<br />the cook responsible...
- He's a garbage boy.<br />- Who made something she liked.
How can we claim to represent<br />the name of Gusteau
if we don't uphold<br />his most cherished belief?
And what belief is that,<br />Mademoiselle Tatou?
Anyone can cook.
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh<br />on our new garbage boy.
He has taken a bold risk
and we should reward that,<br />as Chef Gusteau would have.
If he wishes<br />to swim in dangerous waters,
who are we to deny him?
- You were escaping?<br />- Oh, yeah.
Since you have expressed<br />such an interest in his cooking career,
you shall be responsible for it.
Anyone else?
Then back to work.
You are either very lucky<br />or very unlucky.
You will make the soup again,<br />and this time, I'll be paying attention.
Very close attention.
They think you might be a cook.<br />But you know what I think, Linguini?
I think you are a sneaky,<br />overreaching little...
Rat!
- Rat!<br />- Get the rat.
Linguini. Get something to trap it.
It's getting away. Get it, get it, get it.
- What should I do now?<br />- Kill it.
- Now?<br />- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?
Do you know what would happen to us
if anyone knew<br />we had a rat in our kitchen?
They'd close us down.
Our reputation is hanging by a thread<br />as it is.
Take it away from here. Far away.<br />Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!
