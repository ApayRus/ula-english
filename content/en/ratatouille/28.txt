Colette! Wait, wait!<br />Don't motorcycle away.
Look, I'm no good with words.<br />I'm no good with food either.
At least not without your help.
I hate false modesty.<br />It's just another way to lie.
- You have talent.<br />- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.
When I added that extra ingredient
instead of following the recipe<br />like you said,
that wasn't me either.
- What do you mean?<br />- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.
I would've followed the recipe.
I would've followed your advice.
I would've followed your advice<br />to the ends of the earth.
- Because I love your advice.<br />- But...
But I...
Don't do it.
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.
- I have a...<br />- What? You...
- I have a...<br />- You have a rash?
No, no, no. I have this...<br />This tiny little...

Why is it so hard to talk to you?<br />Okay. Here we go.
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.
I'm going to risk looking like the<br />biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.
You want to know why<br />I'm such a fast learner?
You want to know why<br />I'm such a great cook?
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!
No! No!
