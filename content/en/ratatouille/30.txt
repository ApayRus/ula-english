No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
The DNA matches, the timing works,<br />everything checks out.
He is Gusteau's son.
This can't just happen!<br />The whole thing is a setup!
The boy knows!
Look at him out there,<br />pretending to be an idiot.
He's toying with my mind<br />like a cat with a ball of... Something.
- String?<br />- Yes! Playing dumb.
- Taunting me with that rat.<br />- Rat?
Yes. He's consorting with it.
Deliberately trying to make me think<br />it's important.
- The rat.<br />- Exactly!
Is the rat important?

Isn't it good to have the press?
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name<br />getting headlines?
Not if they're over his face!
Gusteau's already has a face,<br />and it's fat and lovable and familiar.
And it sells burritosl<br />Millions and millions of burritos!
The deadline passes in three days.
Then you can fire him<br />whenever he ceases to be valuable
and no one will ever know.
I was worried<br />about the hair sample you gave me.
- I had to send them back to the lab.<br />- Why?
Because the first time it came back<br />identified as rodent hair.
- No, no, no.<br />- What?
Try this. It's better.
Well, because you...
