You stupid...
Wow. I have never seen that before.
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny<br />or something.
I'm sorry, Remy.
I know there are too many guys.
- I tried to limit...<br />- You know what?
It's okay. I've been selfish.
- You guys hungry?<br />- Are you kidding?
All right. Dinner's on me.<br />We'll go after closing time.
- In fact...<br />- Yeah.
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.
Little Chef?
This is great, Son.<br />An inside job. I see the appeal.
Little Chef?
Little Chef?
Hey, Little Chef.
I thought you went back<br />to the apartment.
Then when you weren't there,<br />I don't know...
It didn't seem right to leave things<br />the way that we did, so...
Look, I don't want to fight.
I've been under a lot of, you know,<br />pressure.
A lot has changed<br />in not very much time, you know?
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,
people will be disappointed.
It's weird.
You know, I've never<br />disappointed anyone before,
because nobody's<br />ever expected anything of me.
And the only reason<br />anyone expects anything from me now
is because of you.
I haven't been fair to you.
You've never failed me,<br />and I should never forget that.
You've been a good friend.
The most honorable friend<br />a guy could ever ask...
What is this?
What's going on?
Hey...
You're...
You're stealing food? How could you?
I thought you were my friend!<br />I trusted you!
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!
And don't come back
or I'll treat you the way restaurants<br />are supposed to treat pests!
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?
We are what we are, and we're rats.
Well, he'll leave soon,<br />and now you know how to get in.
Steal all you want.
- You're not coming?<br />- I've lost my appetite.
