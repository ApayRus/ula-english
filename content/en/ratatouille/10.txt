Champagne!
What are you doing?
I'm hungry.
I don't know where I am,
and I don't know<br />when I'll find food again.
Remy, you are better than that.<br />You are a cook.
A cook makes. A thief takes.<br />You are not a thief.
But I am hungry.
Food will come, Remy.
Food always comes<br />to those who love to cook.
- You think I am playing?<br />- You don't have the guts.
Paris?
All this time<br />I've been underneath Paris?
Wow.
It's beautiful.
The most beautiful.
Gusteau's? Your restaurant?
You've led me to your restaurant.
It seems as though I have. Yes.<br />There it is. I have led you to it.
I got to see this.
