They sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead.
The dark night came on outside.
The fires in the middle of the hall were built with fresh logs
and the torches were put out,
and still they sat in the light of the dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind them,
and dark at the top like trees of the forest.
Whether it was magic or not,
it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters,
and the hoot of owls.
Soon he began to nod with sleep
and the voices seemed to grow far away,
until he woke with a start.
The great door had creaked and slammed.
Beorn was gone.
The dwarves were sitting cross— legged on the floor round the fire,
and presently they began to sing.
Some of the verses were like this,
but there were many more,
and their singing went on for a long while:
The wind was on the withered heath,
but in the forest stirred no leaf:
there shadows lay
by night and day,
and dark things silent crept beneath.
The wind came down from mountains cold,
and like a tide it roared and rolled;
the branches groaned,
the forest moaned,
and leaves were laid upon the mould.
The wind went on
from West to East;
all movement in the forest ceased,
but shrill and harsh
across the marsh
its whistling voices
were released.
The grasses hissed,
their tassels bent,
the reeds were rattling —
on it went
over shaken pool
under heavens cool
where racing clouds
were torn and rent.
It passed the lonely Mountain bare
and swept above
the dragon’s lair:
there black and dark
lay boulders stark
and flying smoke
was in the air.
It left the world
and took its flight
over the wide seas
of the night.
The moon set sail
upon the gale,
and stars were fanned
to leaping light.
Bilbo began to nod again.
Suddenly up stood Gandalf.
“It is time for us to sleep,” he said, “—
for us,
but not I think for Beorn.
In this hall we can rest sound and safe,
but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn said before he left us:
you must not stray outside until the sun is up,
on your peril.”
Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall,
on a sort of raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall.
For him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen blankets.
He snuggled into them very gladly,
summertime though it was.
The fire burned low and he fell asleep.
Yet in the night he woke:
the fire had now sunk to a few embers;
the dwarves and Gandalf were all asleep,
to judge by their breathing;
a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon,
which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof.
