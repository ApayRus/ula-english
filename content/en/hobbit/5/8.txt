The hiss was close behind him.
He turned now and saw Gollum’s eyes like small green lamps coming up the slope.
Terrified he tried to run faster,
but suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor,
and fell flat with his little sword under him.
In a moment Gollum was on him.
But before Bilbo could do anything,
recover his breath,
pick himself up,
or wave his sword,
Gollum passed by,
taking no notice of him,
cursing and whispering as he ran.
What could it mean?
Gollum could see in the dark.
Bilbo could see the light of his eyes palely shining even from behind.
Painfully he got up,
and sheathed his sword,
which was now glowing faintly again,
then very cautiously he followed.
There seemed nothing else to do.
It was no good crawling back down to Gollum’s water.
Perhaps if he followed him,
Gollum might lead him to some way of escape without meaning to.
“Curse it! curse it! curse it!”
hissed Gollum.
“Curse the Baggins!
It’s gone!
What has it got in its pocketses?
Oh we guess, we guess, my precious.
He’s found it,
yes he must have. My birthday-present.”
Bilbo pricked up his ears.
He was at last beginning to guess himself.
He hurried a little,
getting as close as he dared behind Gollum,
who was still going quickly,
not looking back,
but turning his head from side to side,
as Bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.
“My birthday-present!
Curse it!
How did we lose it,
my precious,?
Yes, that’s it.
When we came this way last,
when we twisted that nassty young squeaker.
That’s it.
Curse it!
It slipped from us,
after all these ages and ages!
It’s gone,
gollum.”
Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep,
a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to listen to.
Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel-wall.
After a while
Gollum stopped weeping
and began to talk.
He seemed to be having an argument with himself.
“It’s no good going back there to search,
no.
We doesn’t remember all the places we’ve visited.
And it’s no use.
The Baggins has got it in its pocketses;
the nassty noser has found it, we says.”
“We guesses, precious,
only guesses,.
We can’t know till we find the nassty creature and squeezes it.
But it doesn’t know what the present can do, does it?
It’ll just keep it in its pocketses.
It doesn’t know,
and it can’t go far.
It’s lost itself,
the nassty nosey thing.
It doesn’t know the way out.
It said so.”
“It said so, yes; but it’s tricksy.
It doesn’t say what it means.
It won’t say what it’s got in its pocketses.
It knows.
It knows a way in,
it must know a way out, yes.
It’s off to the back-door.
To the back-door, that’s it.”
“The goblinses will catch it then.
It can’t get out that way, precious.”
“Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it’s got the present,
our precious present,
then goblinses will get it,
gollum!
They’ll find it,
they’ll find out what it does.
We shan’t ever be safe again, never,
gollum!
One of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see him.
He’ll be there but not seen.
Not even our clever eyeses will notice him;
and he’ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum,
gollum!”
“Then let’s stop talking, precious, and make haste.
If the Baggins has gone that way,
we must go quick and see.
Go!
Not far now.
Make haste!”
