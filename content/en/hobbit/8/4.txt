0.33	2.44	They were a gloomy party that night,
2.91	6.48	and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following days.
7.42	9.55	They had crossed the enchanted stream;
10.08	13.44	but beyond it the path seemed to straggle on just as before,
13.82	16	and in the forest they could see no change.
17.37	19.53	Yet if they had known more about it
19.91	24.51	and considered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path,
25.22	29	they would have known that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge,
29.46	30.75	and would soon have come,
31.26	34.04	if they could have kept up their courage and their hope,
34.4	37.73	to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came again.
38.53	40.46	But they did not know this,
41.06	43.62	and they were burdened with the heavy body of Bombur,
44.33	47.28	which they had to carry along with them as best they could,
47.82	51.4	taking the wearisome task in turns of four each
51.71	53.51	while the others shared their packs.
54.26	57.6	If these had not become all too light in the last few days,
57.97	59.68	they would never have managed it;
60.17	65.2	but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs filled with food
65.33	66.22	however heavy.
68.04	73.35	In a few days a time came when there was practically nothing left to eat or to drink.
74.48	77.15	Nothing wholesome could they see growing in the woods,
77.55	81.68	only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell.
83.48	86.17	About four days from the enchanted stream
86.4	89.51	they came to a part where most of the trees were beeches.
90.55	93.66	They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change,
94.35	96.02	for here there was no undergrowth
96.22	97.93	and the shadow was not so deep.
98.71	100.55	There was a greenish light about them,
101.06	104.75	and in places they could see some distance to either side of the path.
105.77	110.08	Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey trunks
110.53	113.28	like the pillars of some huge twilight hall.
114.17	116.48	There was a breath of air and a noise of wind,
117.11	118.75	but it had a sad sound.
119.75	122.64	A few leaves came rustling down to remind them
122.84	124.97	that outside autumn was coming on.
126.15	129.8	Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns
129.8	134.33	that drifted over the banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest.
136.13	138.75	Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary.
139.71	142.35	At times they heard disquieting laughter.
143.15	145.71	Sometimes there was singing in the distance too.
146.75	149.55	The laughter was the laughter of fair voices
149.77	150.91	not of goblins,
151.2	152.97	and the singing was beautiful,
153.46	155.77	but it sounded eerie and strange,
156.35	157.62	and they were not comforted,
158.26	162.48	rather they hurried on from those parts with what strength they had left.
164.71	167.75	Two days later they found their path going downwards
168.06	169.13	and before long
169.42	173.4	they were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.
174.84	178.55	“Is there no end to this accursed forest?”
178.82	179.66	said Thorin.
180.48	182.57	“Somebody must climb a tree
182.95	186.88	and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round.
187.62	191.42	The only way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path.”
193.04	195.6	Of course “somebody” meant Bilbo.
196.51	197.6	They chose him
197.8	201.97	because to be of any use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves,
202.35	206.88	and so he must be light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him.
208.24	211.73	Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees,
212.17	217.93	but they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path,
218.44	220.55	and up he had to go as best he could.
221.86	225.88	He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye;
226.93	230.66	he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs;
231.73	235.26	more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time;
236.2	237.06	and at last,
237.46	240.24	after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place
240.66	243.93	where there seemed to be no convenient branches at all,
244.33	245.51	he got near the top.
246.37	249.73	All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree,
250.11	252.31	and how he was going to get down again
252.77	254.31	except by falling.
255.55	256.31	In the end
256.57	258.97	he poked his head above the roof of leaves,
259.35	261.51	and then he found spiders all right.
262.24	264.88	But they were only small ones of ordinary size,
265.22	267.13	and they were after the butterflies.
267.93	270.46	Bilbo’s eyes were nearly blinded by the light.
271.33	274.53	He could hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below,
274.95	276.06	but he could not answer,
276.4	277.93	only hold on and blink.
278.55	280.35	The sun was shining brilliantly,
280.82	283.15	and it was a long while before he could bear it.
284.13	284.84	When he could,
285.28	288.11	he saw all round him a sea of dark green,
288.4	290.4	ruffled here and there by the breeze;
291.15	294.11	and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies.
