Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside;
but Bilbo escaped into the woods
carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him.
The rest of the night he had to pass
wet as he was and far from a fire,
but the bottle helped him to do that,
and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves,
even though the year was getting late
and the air was chilly.
He woke again with a specially loud sneeze.
It was already grey morning,
and there was a merry racket down by the river.
They were making up a raft of barrels,
and the raft-elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake-town.
Bilbo sneezed again.
He was no longer dripping
but he felt cold all over.
He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him
and managed
just in time to get on to the mass of casks
without being noticed in the general bustle.
Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow,
and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.
There was a mighty pushing of poles.
The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and shoved.
The barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted.
“This is a heavy load!”
some grumbled.
“They float too deep —
some of these are never empty.
If they had come ashore in the daylight,
we might have had a look inside,”
they said.
“No time now!”
cried the raftman.
“Shove off!”
And off they went at last,
slowly at first,
until they had passed the point of rock
where other elves stood to fend them off with poles,
and then quicker and quicker
as they caught the main stream
and went sailing away down,
down towards the Lake.
They had escaped the dungeons of the king
and were through the wood,
but whether alive or dead
still remains to be seen.
