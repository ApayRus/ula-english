Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking,
and beside them strode Beorn,
once again in man’s shape,
and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road.
So they went on
until they drew near to the borders of Mirkwood,
to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out.
Then they halted,
for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood,
even though the king bade them stay a while in his halls.
They intended to go along the edge of the forest,
and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it
and the beginning of the Grey Mountains.
It was a long and cheerless road,
but now that the goblins were crushed,
it seemed safer to them
than the dreadful pathways under the trees.
Moreover
Beorn was going that way too.
“Farewell! O Elvenking!”
said Gandalf.
“Merry be the greenwood,
while the world is yet young!
And merry be all your folk!”
“Farewell!
O Gandalf!”
said the king.
“May you ever appear where you are most needed and least expected!
The oftener you appear in my halls
the better shall I be pleased!”
“I beg of you,”
said Bilbo stammering
and standing on one foot,
“to accept this gift!”
and he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls
that Dain had given him at their parting.
“In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?”
said the king.
“Well, er,
I thought,
don’t you know,”
said Bilbo rather confused,
“that, er,
some little return should be made for your,
er,
hospitality.
I mean even a burglar has his feelings.
I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread.”
“I will take your gift,
O Bilbo the Magnificent!”
said the king gravely.
“And I name you
elf-friend and blessed.
May your shadow never grow less
or stealing would be too easy!
Farewell!”
Then the elves turned towards the Forest,
and Bilbo started on his long road home.
He had many hardships and adventures before he got back.
The Wild was still the Wild,
and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins;
but he was well guided and well guarded —
the wizard was with him,
and Beorn for much of the way —
and he was never in great danger again.
Anyway by mid-winter
Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back,
along both edges of the Forest,
to the doors of Beorn’s house;
and there for a while they both stayed.
Yule-tide was warm and merry there;
and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn’s bidding.
The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified,
and hidden in the deepest holes they could find;
and the Wargs had vanished from the woods,
so that men went abroad without fear.
Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions
and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood;
and it is said that for many generations
the men of his line had the power of taking bear’s shape,
and some were grim men and bad,
but most were in heart like Beorn,
if less in size and strength.
In their day
the last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains
and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild.
It was spring,
and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun,
before Bilbo and Gandalf
took their leave at last of Beorn,
and though he longed for home
Bilbo left with regret,
for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were in springtime
no less marvelous
than in high summer.
At last they came up the long road,
and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them before.
But they came to that high point at morning,
and looking backward
they saw a white sun shining over the out-stretched lands.
There behind lay Mirkwood,
blue in the distance,
and darkly green
at the nearer edge
even in the spring.
There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight.
On its highest peak
snow yet unmelted
was gleaming pale.
“So comes snow after fire,
and even dragons have their ending!”
said Bilbo,
and he turned his back on his adventure.
The Tookish part was getting very tired,
and the Baggins was daily getting stronger.
“I wish now only to be in my own arm-chair!”
he said.
