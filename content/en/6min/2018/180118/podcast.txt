<v Rob> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English–
the show that brings you an interesting topic,
authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.
I’m Rob…
<v Catherine> And I’m Catherine.
In this programme we’ll be discussing <strong>quitting</strong> drinking and staying dry.
<v Rob> Right,
so when you say ‘quitting’,
you mean ‘giving up’ –
and when you say ‘drinking’,
you’re particularly referring to ‘the activity of drinking alcohol’.
<v Catherine> Exactly Rob.
<v Rob> But,
what about staying dry?
It’s nothing to do with the weather?
<v Catherine> No that’s true.
The adjective ‘dry’
here means ‘no alcohol’.
And I,
Rob,
am currently having a dry January.
<v Rob> Ah yes,
your New Year’s <strong>resolution</strong> is to give up alcohol for one month.
Any reason?
<v Catherine> Yes.
I’m doing it in order to improve my health and save some money.
And a resolution,
by the way,
is a promise to yourself to do something or not to do something.
<v Rob> Well they seem like good reasons.
And for now,
we must keep up our resolution to always start the programme with a question,
so are you ready for it,
Catherine?
<v Catherine> I am,
crack on,
Rob!
<v Rob> According to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015,
which country consumed the most alcohol per person?
Was it…
a) Australia
b) Finland
c) The Czech Republic
<v Catherine> Well they’re sound quite likely,
but I did visit Prague once and I had a lovely time,
so I’m going to say c) the Czech Republic.
<v Rob> OK,
well as always,
we’ll find out the answer later on.
But let’s continue our discussion about drinking –
or informally known as boozing –
and trying to give it up.
We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us and that’s why you Catherine,
have decided to quit –
but only for a month.
<v Catherine> Yes just a month but it’s a start and I might continue into February.
But I’m seeing the benefits already.
I’ve managed <strong>to shed</strong> some weight –
most of which I actually put on over Christmas!
<v Rob> I can see.
So <strong>to shed</strong> here simply means ‘lose’.
And I bet your <strong>sobriety</strong> is helping you sleep better.
Sobriety,
by the way,
means ‘the state of not being drunk’.
<v Catherine> It is actually.
And I’m not alone: A study of 857 British adults by Dr Richard de Visser from the University of Sussex found that after going for a month without alcohol,
62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep.
So Rob,
does that tempt you to become teetotal and stop drinking?
<v Rob> Not me Catherine.
I need a drink to help me relax and be more sociable –
you know how shy I am!
<v Catherine> Yes of course Rob!
Well,
maybe you should listen to Catherine Gray.
She’s the author of a book called The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober,
which she wrote after she discovered the negative effects of going to too many work-related parties where she was just drinking too much.
Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme…
<v Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober> I had a lot of social anxiety and when I quit I had to deal with that.
I think I used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>,
a confidence crutch -
it eased the way to go to big glittering parties and stuff like that and when I quit I had to learn real confidence in a way.
<v Catherine> So Catherine worked in the magazine business which involved going to lots of boozy parties.
Drinking,
she says,
helped herdeal with a nervous and worried feeling that she had when she met new people -
she called it social anxiety.
<v Rob> Yes,
and she used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>.
A crutch here is something you depend on for support –
and sometimes you rely on it too much.
<v Catherine> Yes and eventually she decided to <strong>abstain</strong> from drinking –
in other words stop doing something that is enjoyable but bad for you –
and she feels much better for it.
So come on Rob,
haven’t you got the willpower to just quit drinking for just 30 days?
<v Rob> Well according to Catherine Gray,
that wouldn’t be long enough…
<v Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober> Experts say that it takes 66 days for a new habit to <strong>bed in</strong>,
so I would always recommend trying it for 90 days.
30 days is the hard bit before you get to the rewards.
Because after 66 days it starts getting a lot easier and you start feeling better in yourself.
<v Catherine> Right,
so it takes 66 days for doing a regular activity -
a habit -
to <strong>bed in</strong>.
And ‘bed in’
means to ‘become normal and start working properly’.
<v Rob> Now,
earlier I asked you,
according to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015,
which country consumed the most alcohol per person?
Was it…
a) Australia
b) Finland
c) The Czech Republic
<v Catherine> And I said the Czech Republic.
Was I right?
<v Rob> You were Catherine.
Spot on,
well done.
Apparently,
14.1 litres of pure alcohol is consumed per person each year.
<v Catherine> Well like I said,
they do make good beer in the Czech Republic –
but people,
be careful,
only drink it in moderation.
Now Rob,
shall we take a look at the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today?
<v Rob> Indeed.
The first word we had was <strong>resolution</strong> –
that’s a promise to yourself to do or not do something.
‘Catherine’s New Year’s resolution was to give up drinking alcohol for a whole month.’
<v Catherine> Yes,
and I’m still doing it Rob –
the plan is <strong>to shed</strong> a few kilos and get fit.
So for example,
‘Rob shed lots of weight when he went on a cake-free diet!’
<v Rob> Really?
I’d never give up cake Catherine,
but I could be tempted to give up booze as I know <strong>sobriety</strong> is good for my health –
that’s the noun word to mean ‘the state of not being drunk’.
<v Catherine> Now our next word was <strong>abstain</strong>.
That means ‘not do something that is enjoyable but bad for you’.
‘Rob needs to abstain from eating cakes if he wants to wear his skinny jeans.’
<v Rob> Are you dropping a hint there,
Catherine?
Now,
our final word is actually two words –
<strong>bed in</strong>.
It means ‘to become normal and start working properly’.
‘It took a while for the new computer system to bed in but now it’s working perfectly.’
<v Catherine> That’s brilliant because now we can go online and find more BBC Learning English programmes at bbclearningenglish.com.
That’s all for today’s 6 Minute English.
We hope you enjoyed it.
Bye for now.
<v Rob> Bye.
