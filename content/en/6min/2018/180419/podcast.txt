<v Neil> Hello welcome to 6 Minute English.
I’m Neil.
<v Rob> And I’m Rob.
<v Neil> Rob,
when you were a child,
did you have a pet?
<v Rob> Yes,
we had a few pets.
My favourite was a little fluffy hamster.
<v Neil> And what happened to your hamster?
<v Rob> Well one day I got home from school and he wasn’t in his cage.
I was worried for a bit in case he’d escaped or got hurt,
but it was alright.
My mum told me that he had gone to live on a farm so that he could run around with other animals.
<v Neil> Really?
<v Rob> Yes,
really.
<v Neil> A hamster.
Went to live on a farm.
To be with other animals.
Really?
<v Rob> Oh,
well,
when you put it like that.
<v Neil> I think that was probably one of those lies that parents tell their children so as not to make them sad.
<v Rob> Well I’m sad now
<v Neil> Well maybe having a go at this quiz will cheer you up.
According to a study by a US psychologist,
what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation?
Is it:
a) 40%
b) 50%,
or
c) 60%?
<v Rob> I think most people don’t lie that much,
so I’ll say 40%.
<v Neil> We’ll reveal the answer a little later in the programme.
<v Rob> So today we are talking about lies and particularly the lies that parents tell children.
<v Neil> The topic was discussed on the BBC Radio 4 programme,
Woman’s Hour.
<v Rob> A guest on that programme was Doctor Chris Boyle,
a psychologist at Exeter University.
He talks about a particular kind of lie.
We tell these lies not because we want to hurt people.
What colour are these lies called?
<v Dr Chris Boyle> A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> –
as long as there’s not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it’s something that we do.
It’s almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it’s become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.
<v Neil> Dr Chris Boyle there.
What colour is the kind of lie he was talking about?
<v Rob> A <strong>white lie</strong>.
He says a <strong>white</strong> <strong>lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth.
<strong>Distortion</strong> here means a changing or bending of the truth.
These kind of lies are OK as long as we don’t tell them because we want to hurt someone.
<v Neil> He used the phrase <strong>malicious intent</strong> to talk about a bad reason for doing something,
didn’t he?
<v Rob> Yes,
<strong>intent</strong> is the reason or purpose for doing something and <strong>malicious</strong> is an adjective which means cruel or nasty.
So <em>without</em> <strong>malicious intent</strong> means without wanting to hurt or be cruel to someone.
<v Neil> He said that this kind of <strong>white lie</strong> was almost a <strong>societal norm</strong>.
Can you explain what he means by that?
<v Rob> Yes,
something that is the <strong>norm</strong> is something that is expected,
it’s regular and usual.The adjective <strong>societal</strong> comes from the noun society.
So a <strong>societal norm</strong> is something that is regular and common in your culture or society.
<v Neil> So do you think your mum’s story about the hamster and the farm was a little white lie?
<v Rob> Yes,
I’m sure it was.
She didn’t do it with <strong>malicious intent</strong> -
she didn’t want to hurt me.
In fact,
just the opposite,
she wanted to protect me.
<v Neil> Yes,
that’s one kind of <strong>white lie</strong> that parents tell,
to protect children.
There are also a couple of other reasons.
One being the parent’s convenience.
<v Rob> Yes,
I remember my mum telling me on certain days,
the park wasn’t open.
I know now that it never closed,
I guess at the time she was just too busy to take me.
<v Neil> And then there are the cultural lies that parents tell children.
<v Rob> What do you mean by that?
<v Neil> Well first,
if you have any children listening to this right now,
you might want to cover their ears for a few seconds.
RobI’m talking about,
for example,
Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy.
<v Rob> Yes,
there’s no <strong>malicious intent</strong> in telling children those stories.
It is a cultural and <strong>societal norm.</strong>
<v Neil> Let’s listen to Dr Chris Boyle again talking about <strong>white lies</strong>.
<v Dr Chris Boyle> A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> –
as long as there’s not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it’s something that we do.
It’s almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it’s become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.
<v Neil> So now back to our question at the top of the programme.
I asked what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation.
Was it:
a) 40%
b) 50%,
or
c) 60%
What did you say Rob?
<v Rob> I said a) just 40%.
<v Neil> Well I’m afraid the answer was 60%.
<v Rob> Really?
Goodness 60%!
That’s more than I expected.
<v Neil> Right,
well before we go,
let’s recap the vocabulary we talked about today.
The first expression was '<strong>white lie’.</strong> A lie we tell without meaning to hurt someone,
for example when I say to you –
you look nice today!
<v Rob> Wait,
what did you say?
<v Neil> But that is actually a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth.
A changing or bending of the truth.
<v Rob> Mmmm.
This makes me think of the next expression,
'<strong>malicious intent’</strong>.
<strong>Intent</strong> is the reason or purpose for doing something,
and doing something with a <strong><em>malicious</em> intent</strong> is doing it deliberately to be cruel or to hurt someone.
I think you have <strong>a malicious intent</strong>,
telling me that when you say I look nice,
it’s just a lie!
<v Neil> I’m just kidding!
<v Rob> That’s the <strong>norm</strong> for you,
isn’t it,
just kidding.
A '<strong>norm’</strong> is the standard or ‘normal’
way that something is.
In the clip we heard '<strong>societal norm’</strong> whichis the accepted or ‘normal’
way something is done in society.
<v Neil> For example,
telling children about Father Christmas.
<v Rob> Sssh!
But yes you’re right.
<v Neil> Well,
sadly this isn’t a lie but that’s all for this programme.
