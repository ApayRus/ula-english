<v Neil> Hello.
Welcome to 6 Minute English,
I’m Neil.
<v Rob> And I’m Rob.
<v Neil> Rob,
would you say that were a <strong>snowflake</strong>?
<v Rob> Wow,
I can’t believe you said that,
that’s so <strong>offensive</strong>.
How could you be so rude?
<v Neil> So I guess that’s a yes then?
Sorry,
I only asked.
<v Rob> Don’t worry,
I wasn’t really upset,
I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word.
The word <strong>snowflake</strong> has taken on a new meaning in recent years.
These days it’s used as an insult.
It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily <strong>offended</strong> or upset by things that others say.
<v Neil> There is usually a political side to it too,
isn’t there?
<v Rob> Yes,
people who use the word <strong>snowflake</strong> tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left,
particularly millennials -
young,
socially aware adults.
<v Neil> Well we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly,
but first a quiz question.
In which year was <strong>snowflake</strong> one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year?
Was it…
a) 1996
b) 2006
c) 2016
<v Rob> Well,
we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016.
<v Neil> Well,
we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme.
The topic of <strong>offence</strong> is a very complicated one.
First what do we mean by <strong>offence</strong> Rob?
<v Rob> Thanks for that.
That is a really difficult question.
Something that is <strong>offensive</strong> is rude,
insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset.
What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things <strong>offensive</strong>.
Some people can be deliberately <strong>offensive</strong> and some people may be <strong>offensive</strong> without meaning to be.
<v Neil> Also,
different people respond to <strong>offence</strong> in different ways -
some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are <strong>offensive</strong> from saying the things they do.
<v Rob> These terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality,
race,
religion and of course,
politics.
<v Neil> The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason.
Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion.
What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence?
<v Evan Davis> First,
on occasion,
people probably do <strong>invoke</strong> offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to <strong>call out</strong> that discrimination.
<v Neil> He says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement.
He says they <strong>invoke</strong> offence.
<v Rob> If you <strong>invoke</strong> something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action.
So to <strong>invoke</strong> offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said,
although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive.
<v Neil> Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they <strong>call out</strong> discrimination.
They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced.
Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine,
that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be <strong>offended</strong>.
Here’s Evan Davis again.
<v Evan Davis> Where the so-called <strong>snowflakes</strong> surely have a point is this,
societies are entitled to make certain things <strong>taboo</strong> and the millennials use of the word <strong>offensive</strong> is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong.
<v Rob> His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are <strong>taboo</strong>.
In this context something that is <strong>taboo</strong> is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and <strong>offensive</strong> and that it is OK for people to be <strong>offended</strong> by these things.
<v Neil> And I think the point he makes is a good one.
The word <strong>snowflake</strong> is usually used as an insult -
but some people may feel proud to be a <strong>snowflake</strong> because it means they are standing up for a particular standard,
they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them <strong>snowflakes</strong>.
<v Rob> Well I hope we haven’t caused any offence today.
Before we review the vocabulary,
can we have the answer to today’s question Neil?
<v Neil> Of course,
I asked in which year was <strong>snowflake</strong> one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year?
Was it…
a) 1996
b) 2006
c) 2016
<v Rob> And I said c) 2016.
It’s got to be right!
<v Neil> Well,
do you want to hear the story?
Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club,
but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year.
Now let’s review our words of the day.
First there is <strong>offence</strong>.
<v Rob> People can <strong>take</strong> <strong>offence</strong> and be <strong>offended by</strong> something that is <strong>offensive</strong>.
Something that is <strong>offensive</strong> could be rude,
insulting and shocking.
It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.
<v Neil> The term <strong>snowflake</strong> is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily.
They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because <strong>snowflakes</strong> get upset.
Then we had the word <strong>invoke</strong>.
If you <strong>invoke</strong> something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings
<v Rob> To <strong>call something out</strong> is to challenge it,
to highlight it and look for justification.
<v Neil> And finally we have <strong>taboo</strong>.
Something that society says is <strong>offensive</strong> and shocking.
So there we have it.
What do you think Rob of this topic.
<v Rob> Well it is a very difficult subject,
particularly when it comes to politics,
religion and society.
Free speech is good but at times,
particularly on social media,
I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant.
<v Neil> Well,
try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme.
