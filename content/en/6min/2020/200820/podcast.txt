<v Neil> Hello.
This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
I’m Neil.
<v Rob> And I’m Rob.
<v Neil> From the bubonic plague to cholera and tuberculosis,
disease and pandemics have changed the way cities have been built.
For example,
buildings in 19th century Paris were designed with large,
high-up windows to allow plenty of sunlight.
They were supposed to stop the spread of tuberculosis.
<v Rob> Coronavirus has been no different.
In lockdown,
cities from Rio to Barcelona were transformed as wildlife and birdsong replaced the noise of taxi horns and traffic.
And with no car pollution you could even see the stars at night!
<v Neil> In this programme we’ll be asking if cities after lockdown will ever be the same again –
and if we want them to be.
<v Rob> We’ll be hearing some ideas from different cities around the world.
<v Neil> And of course we’ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.
One of the cities most affected by Covid-19 was Mumbai in India –
but approximately how many people were affected?
What’s the estimated population of Mumbai?
That’s my quiz question for you today Rob.
Is it:
a) 15 million people?
b) 20 million people?
or,
c) 25 million people?
<v Rob> I know Mumbai is an international mega-city so I’ll say b) 20 million people.
<v Neil> OK,
Rob,
we’ll find out later if that’s right.
Now,
Beatriz Colomina is a professor of architecture at Princeton University in the United States.
She’s spent years researching the relationship between cities and disease.
Here she is talking with Kavita Puri,
presenter of BBC World Service programme,
<em>The Inquiry</em>:
<v Kavita Puri> Take tuberculosis.
Unlike cholera,
which was eliminated in London by re-designing the sewage system in the 1850s,
TB was <strong>airborne</strong>.
<v Professor Colomina> It became a real problem with the rise of the industrial cities,
the <strong>metropolis</strong>,
before an <strong>antibiotic</strong> was effective.
<v Kavita Puri> One in seven people on the planet had TB,
but in dense cities like Paris,
it was one in three.
Closely packed tenements meant the disease <strong>spread like wildfire</strong> and architects and planning experts responded.
<v Rob> Some diseases,
like cholera,
could be prevented by redesigning cities to improve hygiene,
like the waste water sewers in 19th century London.
But the problem with tuberculosis,
or TB for short,
was that the disease is <strong>airborne</strong> –
carried and spread in the air.
<v Neil> Adding to the problem was the fact that <strong>antibiotics</strong> –
medicines like penicillin that can destroy harmful bacteria or stop their growth –
was not discovered until 1928 –
too late to save the thousands of people who died in Mumbai,
New York,
Paris and other cities during the 1800s.
<v Rob> Diseases like TB killed more and more people as cities industrialised and grew bigger and bigger,
leading to the creation of the <strong>metropolis</strong> –
the largest,
busiest and most important city in a country or region.
<v Neil> Many people crowded together in large <strong>metropolises</strong> meaning that disease could <strong>spread like wildfire</strong> –
an idiom meaning spread quickly around many people.
<v Rob> Even today disease is shaping our cities.
In post-Covid Paris,
new ideas for a ’15 minute city’
aim to make all public services available within a fifteen minute walk to help people working from home.
<v Neil> Other countries want to build better,
more affordable housing outside the city centre.
<v Rob> But according to Mumbai resident Dr Vaidehi Tandel this won’t work –
even if the housing on offer is better.
But why?
The reason is work.
<v Dr Vaidehi Tandel> When you shift them out,
you’re moving them away from their <strong>livelihoods</strong> and they’re not going to be able to sustain themselves there so they will be coming back because their jobs are in the city and they cannot afford the <strong>commute</strong> from further off places.
<v Rob> Dr Vaidehi Tandel there,
talking on the BBC World Service programme The Inquiry.Trying to make cities less crowded is one way to minimise the risks from disease.
But moving people away from the city centre means moving them away from their <strong>livelihood</strong> –
their job or other way of earning money to pay for food,
housing and clothing.
<v Neil> Many people still want to live near their workplace in the city centre because they can’t afford to pay for the <strong>commute</strong> –
the journey between their home and their place of work.
<v Rob> Which is real problem when you live in a city of…
how many people did you say live in Mumbai,
Neil?
<v Neil> Ah yes,
in our quiz question I asked you what the estimated population of Mumbai is.
<v Rob> I said b) 20 million.
<v Neil> And you were absolutely right!
Around 20 million people live in the Mumbai <strong>metropolis</strong>,
making it very difficult to socially distance.
<v Rob> In this programme we’ve been discussing the relationship between cities and disease.
In the 1800s,
tuberculous,
or TB,
killed thousands because it was an <strong>airborne</strong> disease –
spread in the air,
and hard to prevent.
<v Neil> <strong>Antibiotics</strong> –
medicinal chemicals like penicillin which can destroy harmful germs,
couldn’t help because they weren’t discovered until decades later.
<v Rob> So in <strong>metropolises</strong> –
the largest and most important cities,
where people live crowded close together,
diseases <strong>spread like wildfire</strong> –
an idiom meaning spread widely and quickly.
<v Neil> In Mumbai and other places,
the problem remains that many people need the city for their <strong>livelihood</strong> –
job or other way of earning money.
<v Rob> So they prefer to live in the city centre instead of paying for the daily <strong>commute</strong> –
a journey,
often by train,
bus or car,
from your home to your workplace.
<v Neil> That’s all we have time for in this programme,
