<v Neil> Hello.
This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
I’m Neil.
<v Georgina> And I’m Georgina.
<v Neil> Now,
Georgina,
what do you know about AC DC?
<v Georgina> You mean the Australian rock’n’roll band?
Well,
their 1979 hit ‘Highway to Hell’
stayed at No.1 for eleven weeks…
<v Neil> No,
no,
no -
not that AC DC,
Georgina!
I’m not talking rock music here,
I’m talking electrical currents –
alternating current -
AC,
and direct current -
DC,
the two ways in which electricity flows.
<v Georgina> Oh,
I see.
No,
I don’t know anything about <em>that</em> ACDC!
<v Neil> Well,
don’t worry because in today’s programme we’ll be finding out some quirky facts about electricity -
how it differs across the world and why some countries have more complicated electrical systems than others.
<v Georgina> Hmmm,
I have noticed that when I travel to another country I need a converter plug to connect my laptop.
Is that something to do with AC DC?
<v Neil> Yes,
it could be.
Of course,
electricity itself doesn’t change from country to country.
<v Georgina> No.
It’s an invisible,
natural force at work in everything from lightning storms to the electrical sparks firing our brains.
<v Neil> But although it happens naturally,
one scientist was credited with discovering electricity.
Who?
That’s my quiz question –
who discovered electricity?
Was it:
a) Thomas Edison
b) Alexander Graham Bell,
or
c) Benjamin Franklin
<v Georgina> I’m not a qualified electrician myself,
Neil,
but I’ll say c) Benjamin Franklin.
<v Neil> OK.
Well one person who definitely <em>is</em> a qualified electrician is BBC presenter Gareth Mitchell.
So when BBC Radio 4’s ‘Science Stories’
sent him to meet electricity expert Keith Bell,
the conversation was,
shall we say,
sparky.
<v Keith Bell> Standard <strong>frequency</strong> in the US is 60 hertz,
actually I think in the US on the mainland US,
main continent,
there are three different <strong>synchronous</strong> areas.
So although it’s around 60 hertz,
at any moment in time these three different areas,
because they’re not connected to each other,
will be going at a slightly different frequency.
There are bigger differences elsewhere.
So in Japan for example,
I think one of the main islands is at 60 hertz and the other half of Japan is at 50 hertz.
<v Gareth Mitchell> That’s <strong>a bit of a pickle!</strong>
<v Neil> Generally speaking,
frequency means how often something repeats.
In the case of electrical currents,
frequency is the number of times an electrical wave repeats a positive-to-negative cycle.
<v Georgina> It’s measured in hertz (Hz).
In the US power is at 60 hertz and in the UK it’s around 50 hertz.
<v Neil> So the US and UK are not in the same synchronous area –
not occurring together at the same time and rate,
or in this case,
frequency.
<v Georgina> Which means that to safely use a British electrical device in America,
I need to convert the power supply.
If not it won’t work or even worse,
it could break.
<v Neil> And a broken laptop could leave you in a bit of a pickle –
an informal expression meaning a difficult situation with no obvious answer.
Here’s Gareth and Keith again talking about more differences.
<v Gareth Mitchell> I’m pretty sure when I go to the United States,
my electric toothbrush doesn’t <strong>charge up</strong> at 60 hertz -
110 volts,
but my laptop still works.
Maybe you have no comment,
Keith,
but I’m just saying…one of these <strong>anomalies</strong> that I seem to have found.
<v Keith Bell> So,
I’m not sure about the electric toothbrush but I know a lot of our power supplies for laptops and stuff are <strong>solid state</strong>,
you know -
they’ve got electronics in that do all the conversion for you,
so basically it ends up with a DC supply into the machine itself.
So there’s a little converter in there and it’s designed so it doesn’t care what frequency the AC input is.
<v Neil> Gareth noticed that in the United States his toothbrush doesn’t always fully charge up –
get the power needed to make it work.
<v Georgina> Electric toothbrushes which don’t fully charge and differences between electrical frequencies are good examples of anomalies –
things which are different from what is usual or expected.
<v Neil> But with modern technology these anomalies are becoming less and less commonplace.
For example,
computer companies have started making laptops with solid state electronics –
electronics using semiconductors which have no moving parts and can automatically convert different electrical currents.
<v Georgina> Meaning I can use my laptop to google the answer to your quiz question!
<v Neil> Ah,
yes.
I asked you which scientist was credited with discovering electricity.
And you said?
<v Georgina> c) Benjamin Franklin –
and I already know I’m right because I googled it on my solid state laptop!
To show that lightning was electricity,
Franklin attached a metal key to a kite and flew it during a thunderstorm.
The key conducted electricity and gave him a shock!
<v Neil> Hmm,
not an experiment I recommend trying at home!
Today we’ve been talking about <strong>anomalies</strong> –
or unexpected differences in electrical currents between countries.
<v Georgina> Electrical currents are measured in <strong>frequencies</strong> –
the number of times a wave repeats a positive-to-negative cycle.
These can be different if two countries are not <strong>synchronous</strong> –
occurring at the same rate,
for example Britain and the United States.
<v Neil> Different <strong>frequencies</strong> may mean your electrical devices like your laptop,
phone and toothbrush won’t properly <strong>charge up</strong> –
get the power to function,
in other countries.
<v Georgina> And having a phone with no power could leave you <strong>in a bit of a pickle</strong> -
a difficult situation.
<v Neil> Fortunately many modern devices use <strong>solid state</strong> electronics –
non-moving semiconductors inside the machine which automatically convert the electrical current.
<v Georgina> So you’ll never miss another edition of 6 Minute English again!
<v Neil> That’s all for today.
See you soon at BBC Learning English for more interesting topics and related vocabulary.
Bye for now!
<v Georgina> Bye!
