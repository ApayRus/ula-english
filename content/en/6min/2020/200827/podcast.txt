<v Neil> Hello.
This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.
I’m Neil.
<v Sam> And I’m Sam.
<v Neil> What blood type are you,
Sam?
<v Sam> Ah,
you mean the different groups used to classify humans by blood –
types A,
B,
AB and O.
I think I’m type O.
How about you,
Neil?
<v Neil> Well,
it may sound strange but actually I don’t know.
<v Sam> Hmm,
lots of westerners don’t know their blood type,
but in parts of Asia blood groups are a topic of daily conversation.
People select romantic partners based on blood type and different blood groups are associated with different personalities.
<v Neil> In this programme we’ll be finding out all about blood –
why humans have different blood types and whether blood is something more than just a way of pumping oxygen around your body.
<v Sam> And of course we’ll be learning some new vocabulary as well.
Now,
Neil,
I have an interesting fact for you -
did you know that many Japanese popstars’
websites will feature their blood type alongside information like their age and hobbies?
<v Neil> I didn’t,
Sam,
but Japanese culture is certainly interested in blood.
There’s even a word ‘burahara’
meaning ‘blood harassment’,
which is used to describe hostility towards people from a certain blood group considered to be selfish –
but which group?
That’s my quiz question for today –
which blood types may fall victim to ‘burahara’?
Is it:
a) blood type A?
b) blood type B?
Or c) blood type O?
<v Sam> I’ll say a) blood type A.
<v Neil> OK,
Sam,
we’ll find out the answer later.
As we’ve heard,
blood is a big deal in Japan.
Marnie Chesterton,
from BBC World Service programme,
<em>CrowdScience</em>,
travelled to Tokyo where she asked Japanese translator,
Chie Kobayashi,
to explain more:
<v Chie Kobayashi> For blood type A,
generally it is thought they are <strong>perfectionists</strong>,
more detail-oriented,
pretty much good at precise type jobs,
and that makes them good at helping others and good at teamwork and respecting rules and customs.
That’s a typical blood A type.
<v Marnie Chesterton> 40 percent of Japan’s population are sensitive,
anxious type As.
30 percent are curious and <strong>stubborn,</strong> generous type Os.
Ten percent are creative ABs.
But <strong>woe betide</strong> the twenty percent type Bs because they have a far less desirable personality,
apparently.
<v Sam> According to Japanese tradition,
blood type As are <strong>perfectionists</strong> -
people who want everything to be perfect and demand the highest standards possible.
<v Neil> This contrasts with type Os who are considered to be <strong>stubborn</strong> –
people who are determined to do what they want and refuse to change their mind.
<v Sam> But it’s unfortunate blood type Bs who have the least desirable personality –
selfish and independent.
“<strong>Woe betide</strong> the type Bs” remarks the presenter,
Marnie Chesterton –
an informal British expression said when there will be trouble ahead for someone –
in this case,
poor type Bs!
<v Neil> But apart from customs and traditions,
is there actually any science behind these beliefs?
<v Sam> Well,
not according to Dr Emma Pomeroy of Cambridge University’s archaeology department.
She thinks that -
like horoscopes –
there’s no scientific basis for a connection between blood types and personalities.
<v Neil> Which makes me wonder what exactly blood types are.
<v Sam> Blood types are kinds of stickers or chemical markers which support our <strong>immune system</strong> -
the organs,
cells and processes which protect the human body from infection and illness.
<v Neil> Those chemical markers can identify foreign bodies like <strong>pathogens -</strong> small organisms,
such a virus or bacteria,
that can cause disease.
The variety of blood types seems to be a result of different bodily responses to different disease-causing pathogens.
<v Sam> Which explains why blood of the same type is needed in <strong>blood transfusions</strong> –
medical procedures in which blood is taken from one person and put into another person’s body,
often after an accident or during an operation.
<v Neil> And explains the high demand for type O blood which can be given to anyone.
<v Sam> Ah,
generous type Os –
like me.
I always knew I was special…
and curious and stubborn,
wasn’t that the type O personality?
<v Neil> Oh yes,
today’s quiz question was about blood type personalities.
I asked you which undesirable blood type is considered selfish in Japan.
<v Sam> I said a) blood type A.
<v Neil> But as we’ve heard,
it’s actually b) blood type B.
<v Sam> Never mind,
I’ll settle for being curious,
stubborn and generous!
In today’s programme we’ve been talking all about blood types and personalities.
In Japan,
blood type A people are thought of as <strong>perfectionists -</strong> people who want everything to be perfect.
<v Neil> Unlike type Os who are considered <strong>stubborn</strong> –
determined to get their own way and unwilling to change.
<v Sam> And <strong>woe betide</strong> selfish type Bs –
an informal expression said when there will be trouble for someone or if they will be punished for doing a particular thing.
<v Neil> Scientifically speaking,
blood types help support our <strong>immune system</strong> -
the organs and cellular processes which protect the human body from infection.
<v Sam> They also help identify foreign <strong>pathogens -</strong> small organisms,
such a virus or bacteria,
that can cause a disease.
<v Neil> And explain why the same blood type is needed for a successful <strong>blood transfusion</strong> –
the procedure in which blood is transferred from one person’s body to another during an operation.
<v Sam> That’s all we have time for today.
Bye for now.
<v Neil> Bye!
