<v Dan> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English–
the show that brings you an interesting topic,
authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.
I’m Dan…
<v Catherine> And I’m Catherine.
In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids,
as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary,
of course*…*
<v Dan> How would you like to be a mermaid?
<v Catherine> A half-human and half-fish?
Well,
Dan,
I think it’s all a myth.
<v Dan> Well,
then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.
<v Catherine> I suppose I will.
Go on then.
<v Dan> When did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place?
Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?
<v Catherine> Ok,
and by <strong>alleged,</strong> you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’.
I don’t believe in mermaids,
but I think there’s a lot of people who do,
so I will say c) the 2000s.
<v Dan> Well,
we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on.
So,
what do you know about mermaids,
Catherine?
<v Catherine> Well,
a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs,
a mermaid has the tail of a fish.
The males are called mermen,
and they live in the ocean.
I thought they were a myth.
<v Dan> They certainly appear to be mythical.
They feature in legends and stories from all over the world.
The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria,
around 1000 BC.
Can you think of a more modern example?
<v Catherine> Many people will be familiar with the Disney story,
‘The Little Mermaid’.
<v Dan> Yes.
Before it was an animated movie,
it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen,
first published in 1837.
Interestingly,
a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.
<v Catherine> There you go!
There’s no real evidence.
<v Dan> What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro,
North Carolina in the USA?
<v Catherine> You’re telling me fish tales,
Dan
<v Dan> Ok.
I’ll confess.
They aren’t real mermaids.
Each person is a normal human wearing a waist-high latex tail.
They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology,
take underwater photos,
and swim.
For many of them,
it’s a source of income too!
Listen to Daniel Craig,
five year merman,
explain.
<v Daniel Craig, merman> A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids.
They will entertain at birthday parties,
social events,
company events.
I <strong>stumbled across</strong> the mermaiding community merely by accident.
<v Catherine> So it’s a job too!
A professional merman.
And Daniel said that he <strong>stumbled across</strong> it,
or ‘found it by accident’.
So,
it doesn’t really count then though,
does it Dan?
<v Dan> A real,
real mermaid?
<strong>That’s a different</strong> <strong>kettle of fish</strong>,
which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’.
Well,
while we have no hard evidence,
such as a photo of a real mermaid,
there have been several sightings.
One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.
<v Catherine> Hang on now,
that rings a bell!
That’s in Israel,
isn’t it?
And it <strong>allegedly</strong> appeared at sunset.
Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.
<v Dan> There you go then!
<v Catherine> But there is no reason,
Dan,
to believe that it was anything other than a <strong>hoax,</strong> which means 'a deception or lie –
often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’.
Well,
real or not,
it could be fun to be a mermaid.
I wonder what it would be like?
<v Dan> Well,
that I can help with.
Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.
<v Daniel Craig, merman> It’s just <strong>serene</strong>.
It’s the perfect place for a temporary <strong>getaway</strong>.
<v Catherine> So he likes it because it’s <strong>serene</strong>,
which means ‘calm and peaceful’.
<v Dan> Yes and he says it’s the perfect <strong>getaway</strong>,
which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’.
<v Catherine> Well,
I still don’t believe in mermaids,
but I do believe,
Dan,
that you asked me a question.
<v Dan> I definitely did.
I asked,
when did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place?
Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?
<v Catherine> And I said I think it was the 2000s
<v Dan> And you have hit the nail on the head.
Well done.
<v Catherine> Thank you
<v Dan> You’re right.
It was the 2000s.
It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister.
Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme.
Our first word was <strong>alleged</strong>.
If something is <strong>alleged</strong> it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’.
Can you think of a recent example,
Catherine?
<v Catherine> US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news,
but apparently there’s no proof.
And our next one was <strong>stumbled across</strong>.
So,
if you <strong>stumble across</strong> something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’.
It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across.
So,
Dan,
have you ever <strong>stumbled across</strong> anything unusual?
<v Dan> Well,
there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost.
And there on the floor in front of me I <strong>stumbled across</strong> a map of London.
It got me straight to the party.
<v Catherine> Spooky.
<v Dan> The next one after that was **a different kettle of fish.
A different kettle of fish** is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’.
You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’.
<v Catherine> Next up,
we had <strong>hoax</strong>.
And a <strong>hoax</strong> is 'a deception or lie –
which is often done for humour or cruelty’.
What was the last hoax you did,
Dan?
<v Dan> One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present.
I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present.
After that we heard <strong>serene</strong>.
<strong>Serene</strong> means ‘calm and peaceful’.
The noun is serenity.
What’s your idea of serene,
Catherine?
<v Catherine> Two weeks,
lying on the beach,
drinking lemonade,
listening to the sound of the sea.
Fabulous.
And finally we had a <strong>getaway.</strong> A <strong>getaway</strong> is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’,
such as a holiday.
So,
where’s your favourite getaway,
Dan?
<v Dan> My favourite <strong>getaway</strong> is my yoga class.
I find it really,
really refreshing.
