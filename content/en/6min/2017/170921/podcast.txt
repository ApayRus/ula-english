<v Neil> Welcome to 6 Minute English,
where today we introduce a hair-raising topic and six items of vocabulary.
<v Tim> I’m Tim…
So what’s hair-raising about today’s topic,
Neil?
<strong>Hair-raising</strong> means scary but also exciting!
<v Neil> We’re talking about hair –
which may be exciting for some,
but definitely won’t be scary.
<v Tim> Hair-raising is a real thing,
though,
isn’t it?
Our hairs do rise!
<v Neil> Yes –
Tim,
they do.
We get goose bumps when we’re cold,
scared,
or excited.
<v Tim> But other mammals do it better than us –
Cats fluff up when they see other cats they don’t like.
<v Neil> That’s true –
We can’t fluff up because we don’t have enough body hair.
<v Tim> I suppose we used to be as hairy as gorillas –
if you go back a million years or so.
<v Neil> Do you know why we lost so much hair,
Tim?
<v Tim> Isn’t it because it allowed us to sweat more easily?
This meant we didn’t get so hot and tired –
we could run faster and for longer –
and catch more animals to eat!That sounds like a good theory.
But do you have a theory on how many hair follicles the human body has today?
<v Tim> What’s a hair follicle?
<v Neil> A <strong>hair</strong> <strong>follicle</strong> is the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.
Now answer the question,
Tim.
How many hair follicles does the human body have today?
Is it …a) 500,000,
b) 5 million or
c) 50 million?
<v Tim> 50 million sounds about right.
<v Neil> Did you know that men have more than women,
Tim?
<v Tim> No,
I didn’t –
but it makes sense since men are usually hairier than women.
<v Neil> On their faces –
but not necessarily on their heads!
<v Tim> Are you referring to the fact that men of a certain age can be follically challenged?
<v Neil> If you’re follically challenged it means you’re losing your hair!
Having little or no hair is called <strong>baldness</strong>.
And if you’ve reached <strong>a certain age</strong> it means you aren’t young any more!
<v Tim> Why is our hair so important to us,
Neil?
When we aren’t worrying about going bald,
we’re busy shaving,
waxing,
plucking,
and trimming the stuff.
When I say ‘we’
of course I’m referring to people in general.
Not myself…
<v Neil> Well,
a good head of hair indicates health and youth.
And hair on your face –
<strong>facial</strong> hair –
shows when boys have reached manhood.
<v Tim> On the other hand,
going grey or losing your hair shows you’re getting older.Hair today,
gone tomorrow?
<v Tim> Bad joke,
Neil!
<v Neil> Sorry!
It’s true that hair on your head shows signs of aging –
but this isn’t true of all human hair.
Let’s listen to Ralf Paus,
a leading hair loss researcher,
talking about this.**Ralf Paus,
hair loss researcher**The eyebrows get stronger usually in aging men,
the hairs in your nose and in your ears get stronger –
and what a miracle of nature that an organ –
when the entire body is aging actually grows stronger.
So we may even be able to learn from hair follicles how not to age.
<v Tim> Hmm.
I’m not sure I would swap a good head of hair for thick eyebrows and nose hair.
How about you,
Neil?
<v Neil> I agree!
But let’s hear more from Ralf Paus about why some hair gets stronger as you get older.
<v Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher> The hair follicle apparently knows some tricks that the other organs don’t know.
So it’s continuously regenerating itself.
It goes through a so-called hair cycle and part of that we know pretty well –
and that is,
these stem cells that it uses to regenerate cells.
<v Tim> So a hair follicle can <strong>regenerate</strong> cells –
or grow new cells to replace old or damaged ones.
But if that’s only true for eyebrows,
nose and ear hair,
I am not that impressed!
I want hairs on my head to be able to regenerate!
<v Neil> The important thing here is that these cells in the hair follicle may help scientists discover a way to stop other organs of the body aging…
OK,
I’m now going to reveal how many hair follicles on average we have on our bodies.
The answer is…
5 million.
<v Tim> Oh.
So not 50 million then.
<v Neil> Don’t worry,
Tim!
It was a tricky question!
Now let’s go over the words we learned today.
<v Tim> ‘Hair-raising’
means scary often in an exciting way.
For example,
“That ride on the rollercoaster was a hair-raising experience!”
<v Neil> Next is ‘hair follicle’ –
the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.
<v Tim> “Scientists believe that stress can affect hair follicles.”
<v Neil> A number of things can affect hair follicles actually –
age,
disease,
diet…
<v Tim> OK –
but we haven’t got all day,
Neil.
So let’s move on to the next item.
‘Baldness’ –
which means having little or no hair on your head.
<v Neil> “My grandfather is bald and he always wears a hat to cover his baldness.”
<v Tim> Nice example.
Is your grandpa actually bald,
Neil?
<v Neil> No –
he has a fine head of hair.
Now,
if you are a certain age,
it means you are no longer young.
For example…
<v Tim> “All the people at the party were of a certain age…”
<v Neil> How many of them had facial hair,
Tim?
That’s our next word,
and ‘facial’
means to do with the face.
<v Tim> “None of the people at the party had facial hair.” There’s your answer!
<v Neil> That’s unusual,
Tim.
Lots of men have beards these days.
OK –
our final word for today is ‘regenerate’
which means to grow again.
You can talk about regenerating a range of things,
for example…
<v Neil> “The council has plans to regenerate this part of the city.”
<v Tim> “Regeneration of parts of the city is in progress.” –
‘regeneration’
is the noun.
<v Neil> Well,
it’s time to go now.
But if today’s show gave you goosebumps please let us know by visiting our Twitter,
Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it!
<v Tim> Bye-bye!
<v Neil> Goodbye!
