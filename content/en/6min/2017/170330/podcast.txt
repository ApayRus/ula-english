<v Dan> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English–
the show that brings you an interesting topic,
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.
I’m Dan…
<v Neil> …And I’m Neil.
We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.
<v Dan> Everything ok,
Neil?
<v Neil> I am so tired.
One of my children <strong>is as sick as a dog</strong>.
I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them.
<v Dan> <strong>As sick as a dog</strong> is an expression meaning ‘very ill’.
I’m sorry to hear it.
Try and hold on if you can.
<v Neil> Don’t worry.
There’s life in this old dog yet.
<v Dan> Good.
It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently,
the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.
<v Neil> Amazing.
Any success?
<v Dan> Let me ask you in this week’s question.
In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?
Is it
a) 50%
b) 70%
c) 90%
<v Neil> We’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong.
So,
Neil,
I say dog,
what do you think?
<v Neil> A wet nose,
four <strong>paws,</strong> which is what we call the feet of certain animals,
a fluffy coat and a waggy tail?
Man’s best friend?
But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs.
I wonder what makes them suitable?
<v Dan> Well,
I’ll let Dr Claire Guest,
CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one.
<v Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs> Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail,
he is in fact a highly sophisticated <strong>bio-sensor</strong>.
You know,
evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose,
going down to parts per trillion.
People board planes every day that have been <strong>screened</strong> by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board.
Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?
<v Dan> Yes,
and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to <strong>screen</strong>,
or examine for suitability,
for explosives and bombs.
<v Dan> Yep!
Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?
<v Neil> Well,
there’s guide dogs,
or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America.
They help people who are blind to avoid danger.
<v Dan> Nice.
Any more?
Maybe around the home?
<v Neil> Are you referring to guard dogs,
meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary,
theft or trespassing.’
<v Dan> Yep.
Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger <strong>deterrent</strong>,
or reason not to do something,
than an alarm system.
<v Neil> Oh and there’s rescue dogs.
They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes.
<v Dan> Exactly,
dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow.
A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them.
<v Neil> Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time <strong>biosensors</strong> then?
<v Dan> Well,
I don’t know,
but here’s what Jeremy Hunt,
the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter.
<v INSERT> One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question <strong>orthodoxies</strong>,
so if this research is good then I want to know about it,
and I will certainly look at it carefully.
<v Dan> He mentions that this type of research goes against <strong>orthodoxies</strong>,
or generally accepted way of doing things.
But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully.
So let’s hope so.
<v Neil> Yes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor!
And speaking of research,
there was a question I need to know the answer to.
<v Dan> Oh yes.
I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?
a) 50%
b) 70%
c) 90%
<v Neil> And I said 50%
<v Dan> It’s a dog’s life,
Neil.
I’m sorry.
The answer was c) 90%
<v Neil> Wow!
90%!
That’s amazing.
<v Dan> OK.
The first expression we had was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>.
If you are <strong>as sick as a dog</strong> it means that you’re very sick indeed.
When was the last time you were <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>,
Neil?
<v Neil> Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids.
I was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>.
Next we had <strong>paws</strong>.
<strong>Paws</strong> are the feet of certain animals.
They have pads and claws.
Can you give us a few examples,
Dan?
<v Dan> Well,
dogs have <strong>paws</strong>.
So do cats,
rabbits,
bears and mice.
But not horses,
sheep or pigs.
They have hooves.
After <strong>paws</strong>,
we had <strong>biosensor</strong>.
A <strong>biosensor</strong> is a combination of the words biology and sensor.
It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals.
Can you think of a famous historical example,
Neil?
<v Neil> Well,
Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them.
If the canary became ill or died,
they knew that the air was toxic.
Then we had <strong>screen</strong>.
If you screen something,
it means you examine it for its suitability,
such as luggage going through an airport –
where they would <strong>screen</strong> for explosives.
How else can it be used,
Dan?
<v Dan> Well,
these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will <strong>screen out</strong> those annoying pop-up adverts.
I hate those!
After that was <strong>deterrent</strong>.
A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something,
such as the fear of punishment for a crime.
How do you deter your children from being naughty,
Neil?
<v Neil> That’s easy.
I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart.
<v Dan> Good idea!
<v Neil> Finally,
we heard <strong>orthodoxies</strong>.
An <strong>orthodoxy</strong> is a generally accepted way of doing things.
Its adjective is <strong>orthodox</strong> and we often hear its opposite word –
<strong>unorthodox</strong>,
meaning unusual.
Do you do anything <strong>unorthodox</strong>,
Dan?
<v Dan> Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream.
It’s delicious!
But no one will trust me enough to try!
<v Neil> I don’t blame them!
Well,
