<v Neil> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English –
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.
I’m Neil.
<v Catherine> And I’m Catherine.
Now,
this programme is six minutes long.
<v Neil> Yes.
It’s 6 Minute English!
<v Catherine> And we have a challenge for everyone –
can you stay focused for the full six minutes?
<v Neil> Sounds easy?
Maybe not,
because today we’re talking about our <strong>attention spans</strong>: are they shrinking?
<v Catherine> That’s right,
so we’re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something –
that’s our <strong>attention span</strong> –
actually getting shorter?
Now,
one study says that –
in fact,
it claims the human <strong>attention span</strong> is now shorter than that of a goldfish.
<v Neil> Can that be true?
Smartphones,
the internet,
social media –
these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention.
But how much?
How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day,
on average?
Is it…
a) around 30 minutes,
b) around two and a half hours,
or
c) over three hours?
<v Catherine> I tend to be quite busy,
but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I’m going to say around two and a half hours -
that’s answer ‘b’.
<v Neil> OK,
so,
a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds.
Since then it’s fallen to just eight seconds.
<v Catherine> Right,
and that’s a massive change in a very short time.
Now,
the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones,
so many think they’re to blame for all these <strong>distractions</strong> –
now,
distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.
<v Neil> Yes.
And we mentioned goldfish earlier –
goldfish reportedly have an <strong>attention span</strong> of nine seconds.
That’s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds!
<v Catherine> And there’s a phrase in English –
we say ‘to have the <strong>attention span</strong> of a goldfish’.
Or ‘the memory of a goldfish’.
So these poor…
poor gold goldfish,
Neil.
<v Neil> Yes,
they get <strong>a bad press</strong>,
don’t they?
That’s a phrase which means ‘criticism’ –
especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers –
or the ‘press’,
as we call it.
<v Catherine> So –
is it really true than humans are now even more easily <strong>distracted</strong> than fish?
<v Neil> Well,
BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim.
<v Catherine> That’s right.
And they found out a couple of things.
Firstly –
they couldn’t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report.
In other words,
the programme couldn’t find scientific evidence that our <strong>attention spans</strong> are in fact shrinking.
<v Neil> And secondly –
the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring <strong>attention spans</strong> in the first place.
It’s a term that’s widely used,
but it’s not very scientific.
<v Catherine> Sounds <strong>fishy</strong>.
<v Neil> Yes.
<strong>Fishy</strong> means ‘suspicious’,
by the way.
Sorry,
goldfish.
Again.
<v Catherine> So,
are we humans in fact more easily <strong>distracted</strong> than before?
More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs,
a psychologist at the Open University,
if human beings are less able to focus these days.
<v Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open University> It’s all <strong>down to</strong> the individual; it’s all <strong>down to</strong> how you choose to apply your attention.
So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years,
in the age of the smartphone and the internet.
But because someone’s <strong>distracted</strong> by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something,
it doesn’t mean that they then don’t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task.
<v Neil> So she says we’re not necessarily more easily <strong>distracted</strong>.
Instead,
we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.
<v Catherine> That’s right.
She’s really saying we can <strong>multitask</strong> better than before.
And that means we can focus on many different tasks,
each for a shorter period of time.
<v Neil> She said: “It’s all <strong>down to</strong> how you choose to apply your attention.”
Let’s just highlight that phrase <strong>down to</strong>.
Here,
it means ‘depends on’.
It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.
<v Catherine> So –
maybe our <strong>attention spans</strong> aren’t getting shorter,
we just choose to look at our phones a lot more.
<v Neil> Which reminds me today’s question.
I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones,
and you said?
<v Catherine> Well,
my <strong>attention span</strong> is not that short that I can’t remember that I said two and a half hours.
<v Neil> And the answer –
if you believe the research –
is 2.42 hours per day so,
pretty good guess there,
Catherine.
<v Catherine> Thank you.
<v Neil> That comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout.
And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day.
Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day,
Catherine?
<v Catherine> I try not to,
what about you?
<v Neil> It’s probably more than that to be honest.
Now,
I’m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones –
or maybe they’re even touching them now as they listen –
but either way,
let’s have a review of today’s phrases.
<v Catherine> OK,
so first we had <strong>attention span</strong> –
that’s the length of time we can focus on something.
And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be…
Neil?
Neil?
<v Neil> Sorry –
I just got <strong>distracted</strong> there by a message on my phone.
Apologies.
<v Catherine> That’s alright.
So,
next up we had <strong>a bad press</strong>.
Goldfish get <strong>a bad press</strong>.
Social media gets <strong>a bad press</strong>.
And this means they all get criticism in the media.
<v Neil> And we had <strong>fishy</strong>.
If something’s fishy,
it’s suspicious.
<v Catherine> And we had <strong>multitask</strong>.
To <strong>multitask</strong> is to do several things at once.
<v Neil> Then we had <strong>down to</strong>.
Here it means ‘depends on’,
though it can mean other things in other contexts.
You could say,
it’s all <strong>down</strong> to the context!
<v Catherine> And that’s our quick review,
and our programme for today.
So,
did you stay focused all the way through?
Or were you <strong>distracted</strong>?
<v Neil> If you’re looking for <strong>distractions</strong> –
may I recommend our Facebook,
Twitter,
Instagram and YouTube pages?
<v Both> Goodbye.
