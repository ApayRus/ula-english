<v Neil> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English –
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.
I’m Neil.
Today we’re talking about jobs.
<v Dan> And I’m Dan.
And specifically,
we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job…
<v Neil> Yes.
On that note –
Dan,
were you ever asked this question as a kid?
“What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer?
<v Dan> I wanted to be a ninja turtle.
And you?
<v Neil> That doesn’t surprise me.
I think I wanted to be a professional footballer.
I wanted to play for England.
Well,
for many people,
that question gets harder the older they become!
It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call <strong>portfolio</strong> careers these days –
so they can do a bit of everything.
<v Dan> A <strong>portfolio</strong>,
as a noun,
means 'a case for carrying large pictures –
or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves.
But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things –
in this case,
careers.
<v Neil> Indeed,
we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a <strong>portfolio</strong> career.
<v Dan> Sounds like a good combination.
First,
let’s do today’s question –
it’s job-related.
Many surnames in English originally come from professions.
The surname Baker,
for example,
was originally given to people who worked as…
bakers!
What about the surname Bond,
as in double-oh-seven,
James Bond?
Who had this surname?
Was it?
a) Farmers
b) Spies
c) Guards
<v Neil> It can’t be spies,
can it?
So I’m going to guess guards.
C.
<v Dan> Great,
well let’s find out at the end of the programme.
<v Neil> Now,
the <strong>portfolio</strong> career.
Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up.
<v Dan> Which specific example of a <strong>portfolio</strong> career does she mention?
<v Emily Wapnick, Author> More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs -
and it’s not just <strong>to make ends meet</strong>.
A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle.
They’ve got,
you know,
three different businesses that are just thriving.
Or they’re a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong>.
Or they’ve got a career in two different areas.
There’s a guy that I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier –
he makes violins -
and he’s very successful in both.
<v Neil> Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working.
She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier –
someone who makes violins.
<v Dan> She says this trend is more than just about working to <strong>make ends meet</strong> –
in other words,
working to make enough money to live.
And she used another interesting expression –
a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong> –
what’s that exactly?
<v Neil> Well,
an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses –
and the use of <strong>serial</strong> here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again.
Though we should say,
the adjective is more often used for criminal activity –
such as a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>killer</strong> or <strong>serial</strong> <strong>murderer</strong>.
<v Dan> Not the kind of <strong>portfolio</strong> career I had in mind.
A <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>,
on the other hand,
starts and runs business after business.
<v Neil> Another thing,
because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast –
it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing.
In other words,
it’s wise to <strong>add another string to your bow</strong>.
<v Dan> A great phrase,
which really just means ‘to learn new skills you can use in the future’.
I’d like to learn Japanese –
that would <strong>add another string to my bow</strong>.
<v Neil> So desu,
ne?
But choosing a <strong>portfolio</strong> career is not for everyone,
of course.
It often simply comes down to money.
<v Dan> Here’s Charles Handy,
writer and philosopher,
and the man who popularised the term <strong>portfolio career</strong> in the first place.
<v Charles Handy, writer> 80% of the people in <strong>corporate</strong> jobs hate them,
or are dissatisfied with them.
Whereas if you’re doing your own thing,
80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit,
even if they’re not making an awful lot of money.
It’s a balancing job really,
you’re free but you’re poor.
Or you’re slaved but you’re richer.
<v Neil> Sounds like a difficult choice –
be poor or be a slave.
What would you choose,
Dan?
<v Dan> I’d rather be poor and free,
thank you very much.
<v Neil> Well,
let’s explain a term he used –
a <strong>corporate</strong> job.
What does <strong>corporate</strong> mean?
<v Dan> Quite literally,
it’s the adjective from the term corporation -
a <strong>corporate</strong> job is a job at a big corporation,
company or organisation –
usually well paid,
and with certain benefits.
<v Neil> Could we say James Bond has a <strong>corporate</strong> career?
<v Dan> Yes,
I guess so!
And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?
<v Neil> And I said the Bonds were guards.
<v Dan> I’m afraid you were wrong.
Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord.
This word goes back over 1,000 years…
the spying game came much later!
<v Neil> Indeed!
Let’s spy today’s words once more.
We had <strong>portfolio</strong> –
which can be used in different ways.
There’s a <strong>portfolio</strong> career,
as well as the original meaning of a <strong>portfolio</strong> of art.
Any others?
<v Dan> Yes,
people talk about a <strong>portfolio</strong> of investments –
when you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.
<v Neil> Talking of money,
we had to <strong>make ends meet</strong>.
People often work a number of different part-time jobs to <strong>make ends meet</strong> –
to make enough money to live on.
<v Dan> Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>.
<strong>Serial</strong> means doing something repeatedly,
usually a crime!
<v Neil> And an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses.
<v Dan> I’d love to start a business…
First,
I need to learn a new skill -
<strong>add another string to my bow</strong> and learn yoga.
Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business.
<v Neil> Not for me though,
I prefer the <strong>corporate</strong> life –
a secure job in a big corporation!
<v Dan> OK,
but then you can come to my yoga classes after work!
<v Neil> Alright.
<v Dan> And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.
