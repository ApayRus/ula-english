<v Dan> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English –
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.
I’m Dan.
And today we’re talking about…
<v Catherine> Sighing.
I’m Catherine.
<v Dan> Now –
was that a real sigh –
or just one to demonstrate the meaning?
<v Catherine> That one was just for educational purposes,
of course,
Dan.
<v Dan> We’ll be looking at why we sigh,
and learn how sighing keeps us alive!
<v Catherine> Yes,
very interesting.
And it’s not just humans that sigh,
is it,
Dan?
<v Dan> Indeed,
most mammals sigh.
And that brings me to today’s question.
How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour,
on average?
Is it?
a) Twice
b) 10 times
c) 40 times
<v Catherine> I’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour
<v Dan> OK.
Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme.
Now,
what is a sigh,
exactly?
<v Catherine> Let’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker,
a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.
<v Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University> It’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of <strong>resetting</strong> mechanism,
and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind.
Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die.
It is a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>.
<v Catherine> So sighing keeps us alive.
<v Dan> Dr Barker called it a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>.
To survive means to continue living,
especially in difficult circumstances.
A <strong>mechanism</strong>,
here,
means a system of behaviour.
<v Catherine> So,
a <strong>survival mechanism</strong> is something the body does automatically in order to survive.
But,
Dan,
why is sighing a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>?
<v Dan> It’s because sighing can <strong>reset</strong> the lungs.
To <strong>reset</strong> is to return something to its original settings.
We often use this verb when talking about technology.
You can <strong>reset</strong> a computer or a phone.
<v Catherine> OK,
that’s fine.
But how does a sigh <strong>reset</strong> the lungs?
<v Dan> Well,
scientists from UCLA,
that’s the University of California,
Los Angeles,
found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs,
called alveoli,
working properly.
<v Catherine> And without sighing,
these alveoli would collapse and we would die.
We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.
<v Dan> Thankfully,
we don’t have to think about this need to <strong>reset</strong> our lungs.
Sighing is in fact a <strong>reflex</strong>.
<v Catherine> Boo!
<v Dan> Argh!
<v Catherine> There –
you jumped!
And that was a fabulous <strong>reflex</strong>,
Dan!
It’s something our bodies do without thinking,
something you do unconsciously or automatically.
<v Dan> I meant…
argh…
like a man.
Thank you for that,
Catherine.
<v Catherine> You’re welcome.
<v Dan> Do you sigh a lot?
<v Catherine> Well,
I sigh when I’m tired,
and I sigh when I’m relieved.
I <strong>breathe a sigh of relief</strong>.
<v Dan> <strong>To breathe a sigh of relief</strong> –
that’s a great expression.
It means what you think it means –
to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened –
but it’s often used metaphorically.
It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing.
<v Catherine> That’s right.
Now,
I <strong>breathed a sigh of relief</strong> when I found my mobile phone the other day.
I thought I’d lost it.
It was new.
I was so pleased when I found it!
What about you,
Dan?
<v Dan> I tend to sigh to show <strong>frustration</strong>.
And sometimes <strong>resignation</strong>.
<v Catherine> Now,
<strong>frustration</strong> is what we feel when things aren’t going well,
when things are annoying us and they don’t work.
When things are <strong>frustrating</strong>.
<v Dan> And <strong>resignation</strong> is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened,
that we can’t change.
We feel <strong>resigned</strong> to something.
<v Catherine> So,
relief,
resignation,
frustration,
resetting our lungs.
It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!
<v Dan> Well,
actually,
we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour.
But what about…
mice?
<v Catherine> Well,
I said,
I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.
<v Dan> Well,
in fact,
it is 40 times an hour.
The hearts of mice beat faster –
so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.
<v Catherine> Let’s review today’s vocabulary.
<v Dan> We had the phrase <strong>survival mechanism</strong>.
Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.
<v Catherine> We often use this phrase,
and the related phrase defence mechanism,
when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.
<v Dan> Next,
we had <strong>reset</strong>.
You can reset a computer,
or a machine –
to make it work again.
This usually means switching it off and on again.
<v Catherine> And you can reset a password –
this is a little bit different.
It means to set –
or choose -
a new password.
<v Dan> We also had the word <strong>reflex</strong>.
This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control.
For example…
Catherine?
<v Catherine> Yes?
<v Dan> There,
you closed your eyes.
Another <strong>reflex</strong>.
<v Catherine> And we had <strong>to</strong> <strong>breathe a sigh to relief</strong>.
Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen.
I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.
<v Dan> But we sigh for other reasons too.
Two useful sighing words were: <strong>frustration</strong> and <strong>resignation</strong>.
<v Catherine> <strong>Frustration</strong> is the state of being <strong>frustrated</strong>.
We can say something is <strong>frustrating</strong>.
It’s <strong>frustrating</strong> when the boss doesn’t listen to me.
<v Dan> But let’s say you move beyond feeling <strong>frustrated</strong> and start feeling <strong>resigned</strong>.
<v Catherine> Yeah,
and that would be when I finally accept the boss will never listen to me.
And that’s when I’ll <strong>resign</strong>!
<v Dan> To <strong>resign</strong> also means to voluntarily leave a job!
Please,
Catherine,
tell me that’s just another vocabulary example?!
<v Catherine> Of course it is,
Dan.
I love my job!
I only ever sigh,
what,
12 times an hour?!
<v Dan> Which is perfectly average.
