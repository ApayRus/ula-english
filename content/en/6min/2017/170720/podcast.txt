<v Neil> Welcome to 6 Minute English,
the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six items of useful vocabulary.
I’m Neil.
<v Dan> And I’m Dan.
<v Neil> Now,
Dan,
have you ever wanted to become <strong>invisible</strong>?
<v Dan> <strong>Invisible</strong> –
impossible to see.
Of course!
Who hasn’t?
<v Neil> Well how about this: most of us think we <em>are</em> in fact invisible,
at least some of the time…
We’ll be looking at the ‘<strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>’ in this programme.
<v Dan> Fascinating.
And in that phrase we heard our first three words.
<strong>Invisibility</strong> –
the state of being <strong>invisible</strong>.
A <strong>cloak</strong> is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders.
<v Neil> And the third word in that phrase –
an <strong>illusion</strong> –
is something that seems real but isn’t.
<v Dan> OK,
question time.
Which of these stories features an <strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong>?
Is it…
a) The Hobbit
b) Harry Potter
Or c) The Invisible Man
<v Neil> I know they are all connected to invisibility,
but I’m gonna say…a) The Hobbit.
<v Dan> Ok –
we’ll reveal the answer later on.
Now,
let’s hear more about this <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>.
What’s the theory,
Neil?
<v Neil> Right –
imagine you’re sitting in a crowded train.
People are busy looking at phones and books,
but they’re also looking at each other.
<v Dan> They’re ‘people-watching’,
as we call it.
Yes.
Yes,
I do that.
I do it a lot,
if I’m honest!
<v Neil> So –
where does the <strong>invisibility</strong> part come in?
<v Dan> A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this.
Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University.
What did the Yale team find?
<v Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University> So this study,
they asked people that,
first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody,
and how much they thought those people were observing them.
And there was always a <strong>mismatch</strong>.
People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them.
<v Dan> So,
people think they observe others more than others watch them.
Everyone thinks they aren’t observed very much -
it’s almost as if they’re <strong>invisible</strong> to others –
or wearing an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>!
<v Neil> And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and <em>think</em> they’re being watched is what she called a <strong>mismatch</strong>.
It’s the difference between two things –
they’re two things which don’t ‘match’.
<v Dan> In other words –
it’s not true that people aren’t watching us –
which is why the idea of having an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> is just an <strong>illusion</strong>.
This next bit is interesting.
Two people were asked to wait in a room.
Then they were each asked to make two lists: one,
what they noticed about the other person; and two,
what <em>they thought</em> the other person noticed about them.
<v Neil> So list one was always longer than list two.
Not only that –
but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists.
<v Dan> Let’s hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday.
What was the difference?
<v Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University> When people are observing you they’re doing it in a non-<strong>judgemental</strong>,
fairly empathic way –
and not actually noticing the things that you’re <strong>self-conscious</strong> about.
So if for example you feel <strong>self-conscious</strong> about a spot on your nose,
or something that you’re wearing,
that won’t be what they’re noticing.
It’s a much less <strong>judgemental</strong> form of observation.
<v Neil> Right,
so even if we’re feeling <strong>self-conscious</strong> about something –
that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves –
maybe our appearance or our clothes –
we needn’t be.
<v Dan> Yes,
you don’t need to feel <strong>self-conscious</strong>.
People aren’t being <strong>judgemental</strong>.
<v Neil> And being <strong>judgemental</strong> means being critical.
<v Dan> That’s good news.
So even though all I’m thinking about is how badly I need a haircut,
the other person is probably noticing something completely different.
Back to the question about the <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>.
Which story is it in?
<v Neil> I said The Hobbit.
<v Dan> And it was in fact –
Harry Potter.
Not only does the garment make you impossible to see,
it also protects you against magic spells.
<v Neil> Wow –
I need one of those!
<v Dan> In The Hobbit,
it’s a ring that makes you <strong>invisible</strong>,
and in The <strong>Invisible</strong> Man,
the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect.
<v Neil> Now,
before we become <strong>invisible</strong> ourselves,
how about we go through today’s words?
<v Dan> Marvellous.
First we had <strong>invisible</strong> –
which meansimpossible to see.
You could say that stars are <strong>invisible</strong> during the day.
<v Neil> They’re only visible at night.
<v Dan> We also had <strong>cloak</strong> –
who would wear a cloak?
Maybe a king or a monk?
Or maybe you,
Neil?
<v Neil> I’m sure I could look good in a <strong>cloak</strong> –
that’s a long piece of material worn over the shoulders.
What about <strong>illusion</strong>?
<v Dan> <strong>Illusions</strong> appear to be true,
but they’re not.
It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the <strong>illusion</strong> that everything he says is true.
Then we had <strong>mismatch</strong> –
which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there’s a <strong>mismatch</strong> between what Michael says and what he does.
<v Neil> Who’s Michael?
<v Dan> Just an example!
You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple –
they seem very different –
they’re a bit of a <strong>mismatch</strong>.
<v Neil> What is it with you and Michael?!
One,
he doesn’t exist,
and two,
I think you’re being <strong>judgemental</strong>.
<v Dan> Well,
I’m criticising him so,
yeah,
you’re right –
I’m being <strong>judgemental</strong>.
Perhaps I should stop.
It’s just that…
it’s just that I’m in love with Simone myself,
and I get all nervous and <strong>self-conscious</strong> when I see her.
<v Neil> You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you –
you become <strong>self-conscious</strong>?
<v Dan> I do.
<v Neil> Even though she doesn’t exist either?
<v Dan> Well,
only in my examples.
Sometimes I wish I really did have an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>.
<v Neil> Hey,
hang on,
Dan -
where have you gone?
<v Dan> Haha –
very funny,
I’m still perfectly visible.
Time to go –
but do visit our Facebook,
Twitter,
Instagram and YouTube pages,
and of course our website!
<v Neil> Goodbye for now.
<v Both> Bye!
