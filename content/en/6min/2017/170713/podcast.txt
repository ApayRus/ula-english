<v Neil> Welcome to 6 Minute English,
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases.
I’m Neil.
<v Dan> And I’m Dan.
Today we’re talking about one of the last mysteries of science.
No,
not if the universe will keep expanding forever,
but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?
<v Neil> We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home –
but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.
<v Dan> We’ll hear the view of one scientist today.
But before that –
I have to ask an important question: Neil,
are you <strong>a cat person</strong> or <strong>a dog person</strong>?
<v Neil> Oh,
that’s easy –
I’m <strong>a cat person</strong>,
for sure.
Dogs are just a…
well,
they are hard work,
aren’t they?
<v Dan> If you say you are ‘<strong>a cat person</strong>’ it means you prefer cats.
‘<strong>A coffee person</strong>’ prefers coffee.
A ‘something’ person likes or prefers that thing,
often over another thing.
<v Neil> Back to the topic,
I’m <strong>a cat person</strong>.
But can you answer this,
Dan?
Recently,
a cat called Omar made headlines for being,
possibly,
the world’s longest cat.
How long is Omar?
Is it…
a) 120 cm
b) 80 cm
Or c) 180 cm
<v Dan> I’m gonna say c) 180 cm.
<v Neil> Now,
from long cats to long-distance cats.
Scientists were <strong>scratching their heads</strong> a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home.
How did it do it?
<v Dan> We say you ‘<strong>scratch your head</strong>’ when you are confused about something.
There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate –
but we don’t yet have the full answer.
<v Neil> Well,
both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell,
of course.
Smells are like signposts –
they let you know where you are.
Visual <strong>landmarks</strong> also play a role,
just as they do with humans.
A <strong>landmark</strong> is something very easily recognised –
a big building or mountain for example.
<v Dan> And what about this one: <strong>magnets</strong> are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal -
for example,
iron or steel.
The Earth itself has a <strong>magnetic</strong> force.
<v Neil> Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles –
it tells them where north is.
It’s thought they have some iron in their beaks.
<v Dan> But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.
<v Neil> So we have a few ideas –
smell,
<strong>landmarks</strong>,
<strong>magnetic</strong> forces –
but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?
<v Dan> Let’s hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw.
How do cats build up the maps in their heads?
<v Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol> What they do when they are in a new <strong>territory</strong> is explore it in a very <strong>systematic</strong> way.
So they will go out in ever-increasing circles,
they’ll literally construct a mental map in their heads.
And so a cat that’s lost its territory probably does the same thing.
They’ll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they’ll either come across the <strong>territory</strong> or they’ll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home.
<v Dan> Cats have a <strong>systematic</strong> approach –
which means they use a <strong>system</strong>.
Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle,
then a bigger one and then a bigger one –
until they have a strong mental map of the place.
<v Neil> Yes –
a mental map is a map in your head –
stored in your memory.
And the area cats explore –
their home area -
is called their <strong>territory</strong>.
Cats are <strong>territorial</strong> –
which means their <strong>territory</strong> is very important to them.
<v Dan> Having a map is great,
but what happens when a cat gets lost?
Dr Bradshaw says that again,
it moves around in bigger and bigger circles,
until it finds a clue –
which is a <strong>landmark</strong> or a smell –
that tells it where it is.
Well,
that’s the theory.
Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don’t have enough data –
that’s enough information about this.
<v Neil> When there is a scientific breakthrough -
we’ll bring it to you in 6 Minute English,
I hope.
For now,
let’s content ourselves with Omar,
possibly,
the world’s longest cat.
How long,
Dan?
<v Dan> I said 180 cm.
<v Neil> Omar measures 120 cm –
that’s over two thirds of my height –
and weighs a heavy 14 kg.
<v Dan> Well,
one thing,
Neil,
if Omar ever got lost,
he’d be found in no time.
<v Neil> He’s a <strong>landmark</strong> in himself!
Which reminds me –
let’s run through today’s words again.
If you’re <strong>a cat person</strong>,
you prefer cats.
If you’re <strong>an evening person</strong> –
you prefer evenings.
<v Dan> I’ve always thought you were a kind person,
Neil.
<v Neil> Nice of you to say,
but we only use the phrase with nouns,
not adjectives!
<v Dan> Indeed.
We don’t want the listeners to be <strong>scratching their heads</strong>.
<v Neil> No,
we can’t confuse them!
So let’s explain the next one clearly –
a <strong>landmark</strong> is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are.
The bridges in London are <strong>landmarks</strong>.
<v Dan> And can we say the parks are <strong>magnets</strong> in summer?
A <strong>magnet</strong> is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel –
but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things.
Two more words: <strong>territory</strong> is a noun –
the area of land that an animal considers to be its own.
<v Neil> Animals who feel this strongly are described as <strong>territorial</strong>.
Humans can be too –
about land or subjects they feel they own or control.
<v Dan> And finally <strong>systematic</strong>: the adjective from system.
We can talk about a <strong>systematic</strong> approach,
a <strong>systematic</strong> solution,
a <strong>systematic</strong> study…
<v Neil> And we have <strong>systematically</strong> worked our way through all of today’s words!
<v Dan> Very good!
Which means –
it’s time mention our own online <strong>territory</strong> –
our website and social media pages.

<v Dan> Bye bye for now.
<v Neil> Goodbye!
