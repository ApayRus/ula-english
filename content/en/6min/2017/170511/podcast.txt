<v Dan> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English–
the show that brings you an interesting topic,
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.
I’m Dan…
<v Neil> And I’m Neil.
In this episode we’ll be discussing food waste,
just as soon as….
<v Dan> Neil,
did you just throw the rest of that apple away?
<v Neil> Yeah.
It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it.
<v Dan> Neil,
you know you shouldn’t <strong>waste</strong> food.
<v Neil> <strong>Waste</strong> meaning to throw away without consuming or using.
Ah,
it’s only an apple.
It’s not the end of the world,
Dan.
<v Dan> Well,
that’s where you could be wrong,
my friend.
Let me prove it to you,
with this week’s question.
How much of the world’s food is wasted each year?
a) a half
b) a third
c) a quarter
<v Neil> I’m not sure.
I know it’s a lot so I’m going to say a) a half
<v Dan> We’ll find out if you’re right or not at the end of this show.
So,
the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food,
which is enough to feed a billion hungry people.
Where do you think all this food waste comes from?
<v Neil> Well,
restaurants,
I imagine.
I mean,
they can’t give one customer’s <strong>leftovers</strong> to another!
That would be unhygienic!
<v Dan> <strong>Leftovers</strong> are the remains of food which has not been eaten.
And while you are right,
restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste.
<v Neil> Supermarkets!
I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date,
or the date which it can be legally sold by.
<v Dan> Think closer to home.
<v Neil> It’s us,
isn’t it?
<v Dan> Yes.
In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households,
which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year.
And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it?
<v Neil> I want to say recycle,
but I can see from your face,
Dan,
that it’s not.
<v Dan> No.
Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays.
<v Neil> A <strong>landfill</strong> is a place where rubbish is buried.
I see,
so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change.
<v Dan> Exactly,
and the end of the world.
But,
remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%
<v Neil> That’s impressive,
how did that happen?
<v Dan> They attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul.
<v Neil> I’ve heard about her.
She became a <strong>household name</strong> in Denmark overnight!
<v Dan> <strong>A household name</strong> is one which everybody knows,
and that’s right.
<v Neil> I thought she was Russian?
<v Dan> She is.
But,
I’ll let her explain.
<v INSERT> I come from a country where there were food shortages,
back then in Moscow,
communism collapsed,
we had the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>,
we were not sure we could get food on the table.
And coming to Denmark,
seeing this <strong>abundance</strong>,
seeing these supermarkets filled with food.
But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.
<v Neil> So Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>,
meaning the basic systems and services of a society –
such as food transportation.
<v Dan> Then when she moved to Denmark,
she found an <strong>abundance</strong>,
or more than enough,
food,
but she saw it being wasted.
<v Neil> So she decided to do something about it?
<v Dan> Yes.
She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’
and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste.
<v Neil> How did she do it?
<v Dan> Well,
lots of ideas really.
She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need.
She’s produced a <strong>leftovers</strong> cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools.
<v Neil> Wow,
she’s a busy woman.
So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question.
<v Dan> Sure!
I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year?
a) a half
b) a third
c) a quarterAnd I said a) a half
<v Dan> And I’m terribly sorry,
mate,
but you’re wrong.
The answer is b) a third.
<v Neil> Well,
it’s not as bad as I thought it was,
at least.
<v Dan> Shall we look at the vocabulary then?
<v Neil> Yes,
let’s.
First we had <strong>waste</strong>.
If you <strong>waste</strong> something,
you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it.
Common things we <strong>waste</strong> are food,
time,
money and energy.
We also have some expressions with <strong>waste</strong> too.
Can you think of one,
Dan?
<v Dan> A <strong>waste of space</strong> is an expression which means a thing is completely without value.
For example,
I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen.
I can’t cook at all.
Next we had **leftovers.
Leftovers** are the remains of food or a meal,
which have not been eaten.
What do you tend to do with your <strong>leftovers</strong>,
Neil?
<v Neil> Oh I love <strong>leftovers</strong>!
Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal!
<v Dan> I agree!
Pizza’s a great example!
<v Neil> Then we had <strong>landfill</strong>.
A <strong>landfill</strong> is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried.
In colloquial English we might say,
a <strong>dump</strong>.
Do you ever take your rubbish to the <strong>dump</strong>,
Dan?
<v Dan> Not if I can help it.
I prefer to recycle as much as possible.
I only go to the <strong>dump</strong> if I have to get rid of a large appliance,
such as a fridge.
Then we had <strong>a household name</strong>.
To be <strong>a household name</strong> is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture.
Can you think of a person who is <strong>a household name</strong> at the moment,
Neil?
<v Neil> Oh,
that’s very easy.
Donald Trump springs to mind!
Everyone must know who he is.
Then we had <strong>infrastructure</strong>.
<strong>Infrastructure</strong> is the basic systems and services of a society –
such as electricity supply,
trains,
and roads.
<v Dan> And finally we had <strong>abundance</strong>.
If you have an <strong>abundance</strong> of something,
you have more than you need.
Do have anything in <strong>abundance</strong>,
Neil?
<v Neil> Well,
when it comes to my children I have to have an <strong>abundance</strong> of patience….well,
most of the time.
And,
that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.
