<v Neil> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
I’m Neil and joining me today is Dan who is a producer at BBC Learning English –
that’s his job.
<v Dan> Hi everyone…
Yes that is my job,
obviously –
why are we discussing that now,
Neil?
<v Neil> Well you haven’t always been a producer at BBC Learning English,
have you?
<v Dan> No…
I used to be a teacher.
<v Neil> And before that?
Way back –
your first ever job?
<v Dan> Ah,
I had a <strong>paper round</strong> when I was 14.
A paper round is a job –
the job of delivering newspapers to people’s homes.
It’s often done by teenagers.
<v Neil> 14 seems very young to be at work.
And that’s the topic of this 6 Minute English: Should schoolchildren have jobs?
It seems fewer and fewer are these days,
according to the statistics.
We’ll give you 6 job-related words and expressions –
and,
of course,
our quiz question.
You Ready?
<v Dan> You bet!
<v Neil> What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?
a) 12
b) 13
c) 14
<v Dan> Well,
I’m going to say 14 just because that’s how old I was and it seems a long time ago!
<v Neil> We’ll find out at the end of the programme.
Let’s start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their <strong>Saturday jobs</strong>.
<v Dan> A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work that teenagers do for extra money.
As the name suggests,
these jobs often take place on Saturdays –
but not always.
<v Neil> That’s right -
‘Saturday job’ is general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers.
The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week,
in fact!
Let’s hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.
<v Insert Vox> We have to face all the stuff on the shelves and make it look organised and show customers where products are if they need to know.
On the average week I work nine hours,
so two hours for two school nights and then I work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday.
And then in the school holidays I can work more.
<v Dan> The first kid said the work involves making the shelves look organised.
Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.
<v Neil> Oh yes,
I spent many a weekend and evening stacking shelves!
The second teenager’s Saturday job takes place Saturdays,
Sundays and evenings.
As we said –
A Saturday job’s not just for Saturdays.
<v Dan> A Saturday job is seen almost as a <strong>rite of passage</strong> in the UK.
A rite of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies that form an important stage in a person’s life.
<v Neil> That’s right –
like graduating from school,
or having children.
But according to the latest statistics in the UK,
that is all changing.
Listen to this BBC report.
<v Insert BBC reporter> In order to work,
they need a permit from the local authority and our data shows the number being issued has fallen from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016.
Employers frequently <strong>bemoan</strong> the lack of work experience young people have.
But teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies instead.
<v Dan> So,
it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs.
But there’s a conflict here.
<v Neil> Yes,
on the one hand,
employers bemoan the lack of work experience young people have.
Bemoan,
meaning complain about.
It’s a rather formal word.
<v Dan> But on the other hand,
teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies.
Some people think working could be <strong>detrimental</strong> to a schoolchild’s academic progress.
<v Neil> Detrimental -
which means causing harm.
It’s a tricky one,
isn’t it?
I think my Saturdays spend stacking shelves and serving fish ‘n’ chips taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money.
I don’t think it was detrimental to my education.
<v Dan> Well,
you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English!
As for me,
my paper round taught me the value of hard work.
It didn’t <strong>hinder</strong> me.
Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.
<v Neil> Well let’s not talk too much in case we hinder our students…
On to the answer to our quiz question.
I asked this: What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?
a) 12
b) 13
c) 14
<v Dan> I said c) 14.
<v Neil> And I’m afraid you are wrong.
You are allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK.
Exceptions to this rule include TV,
theatre and modelling.
<v Dan> Oh well –
I guess I should have spent more time at school.
<v Neil> Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?
<v Dan> Did you have a paper round as a kid,
Neil?
<v Neil> No I didn’t,
but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers -
in return for a pound.
Big money back in the 80s!
<v Dan> Did you supplement your earnings with a <strong>Saturday job</strong>?
<v Neil> I did.
I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fish ‘n’ chip shop –
but it wasn’t always on a Saturday.
Free chips!
Dan is that a wedding ring on your finger?
<v Dan> Yes it is.
Marriage is a rite of passage in many cultures.
It is an important stage in a person’s life –
talking of which,
are those your kids on your screensaver?
<v Neil> Yep –
having children is another example of a rite of passage.
See how tired I look!
<v Dan> Do not bemoan your lack of sleep!
Bemoan’s a quite formal way of saying ‘complain about’.
<v Neil> I think it’s OK to bemoan my lack of sleep –
it can have a detrimental effect on my health.
<v Dan> Detrimental –
meaning harmful.
As long as your tiredness doesn’t hinder your work on 6 Minute English
<v Neil> Well,
I’d never let anything hinder –
meaning stop from making progress –
6 Minute English.
<v Dan> I admire your dedication!
Goodbye!
<v Neil> See ya!
