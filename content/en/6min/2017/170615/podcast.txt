<v Neil> OK,
I want you to close your eyes.
Focus…
on your breathing.
<v Catherine> Er,
Neil?
Can we do this later?
We’ve only got six minutes.
<v Neil> Ok,
Catherine.
Welcome to a <strong>mindful</strong> edition of 6 Minute English,
where we’re exploring the rise of <strong>mindfulness</strong> –
particularly in schools.
<v Catherine> And we’ll be teaching six items of vocabulary along the way.
So I think we should start with <strong>mindfulness</strong> itself.
<v Neil> Being <strong>mindful</strong>,
as an adjective,
means ‘being calmly aware of everything in your body and mind’.
You only focus on ‘now’.
<v Catherine> People practise <strong>mindfulness</strong>,
the noun,
by focusing only on their breath,
and not allowing themselves to be distracted by passing thoughts.
<v Neil> Indeed.
It’s traditionally associated with Buddhism,
and has become incredibly popular in the <strong>secular</strong> world –
in workplaces,
in private classes and even in schools.
<v Catherine> means ‘non-religious’ by the way.
<v Neil> OK,
I just mentioned schools: how many teachers in the UK are trained to teach <strong>mindfulness</strong>?
Is it…
a) 500,
b) 5,000 or
c) 50,000?
<v Catherine> Let me focus really hard –
I think it’s 5,000.
<v Neil> A very <strong>mindful</strong> answer,
Catherine.
But I’ll reveal the real answer later.
Now let’s hear from one teacher who’s been practising <strong>mindfulness</strong> with students for many years.
Alison Mayo,
Head of Early Years at Dharma Primary School,
thinks it’s particularly suited to young children.
Why?
<v Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years, Dharma Primary School> That’s very natural for children -
to be <strong>in the present</strong>.
And we really kind of celebrate that because that is a place where they are learning.
So,
if they feel <strong>grounded</strong>,
then they can really develop their concentration and their focus,
and relax.
Learning happens so much more easily if you’re relaxed and happy.
<v Neil> Alison said it was natural for children to be <strong>in the present</strong>.
<v Catherine> <strong>The present</strong> –
means ‘now’.
You’ll know it from the ‘present tense’ in grammar.
And people who practise <strong>mindfulness</strong> use this phrase a lot –
to be <strong>in the present</strong>,
or <strong>in the present moment</strong>.
<v Neil> It sounds simple,
but actually it’s very hard to achieve.
<v Catherine> Well,
Neil,
it might be for an old chap like you,
but for young people,
Miss Mayo thinks it’s very natural.
<v Neil> Fair enough.
Being <strong>grounded</strong>,
as she says,
helps students concentrate and learn in a relaxed way.
<v Catherine> <strong>Grounded</strong> is another good adjective there –
it means 'rational,
sensible,
clear thinking’.
<v Neil> So,
she’s a fan of <strong>mindfulness</strong>.
And there’s growing evidence behind its benefits.
<v Catherine> Yes.
The UK’s national health advisory body has recommended it to help treat conditions like depression and anxiety.
<v Neil> Studies have shown it reduces levels of the stress hormone,
cortisol.
<v Catherine> And a new study has claimed that eating <strong>mindfully</strong> can actually help people to lose weight.
<v Neil> You mean eating slowly?
<v Catherine> Yeah,
slowly and really experiencing and tasting the food.
Not being distracted and not eating too much too fast!
Anyway,
Neil,
is <strong>mindfulness</strong> taking over the world?
<v Neil> Well,
not quite yet.
There still aren’t many detailed studies on it –
and some critics say the studies we have show a publication <strong>bias</strong>.
In other words,
only the positive results are published.
<v Catherine> A <strong>bias</strong> is when you support something or someone in an unfair way,
because of your preferences or beliefs.
<v Neil> What seems certain is that <strong>mindfulness</strong> has entered into many aspects of modern life,
at least here in the UK.
Now,
let’s look back at our question.
I asked how many teachers in the UK have been trained in <strong>mindfulness</strong>.
<v Catherine> And I said 5,000.
<v Neil> Well,
it was actually 5,000.
Well done!
According to the <strong>Mindfulness</strong> Initiative.
And it keeps on growing.
<v Catherine> So before we finish up,
here’s another question that might be useful for our listeners –
what’s the difference between <strong>mindfulness</strong> and <strong>meditation</strong>?
<v Neil> Aha –
that’s not so easy to define.
<strong>Meditation</strong> is the broader term.
When you <strong>meditate</strong> you spend time quietly –
focusing your mind -
often for relaxation or spiritual purposes.
<strong>Mindfulness</strong> is a particular a kind of <strong>meditation</strong> –
when you try to empty your mind of thought.
Does that make sense?
<v Catherine> Yeah,
more or less.
So we’ll let our listeners <strong>meditate</strong> on that answer.
And before we empty our minds,
let’s look back at today’s words.
We had <strong>mindfulness</strong>,
<strong>mindful</strong> and <strong>mindfully</strong> –
they all relate to the particular practice of being only focused of what’s happening now.
<v Neil> What’s happening now,
or we could say –
what’s happening <strong>in the present</strong>.
People often focus on the past –
thinking back about mistakes or happy memories…
<v Catherine> Or on the future –
which can be full of worries.
But by being <strong>in the present</strong> –
you overcome these thoughts and fears.
Next we had <strong>secular</strong>.
It contrasts with ‘religious’.
So,
while a church is a religious building,
we also have <strong>secular</strong> buildings –
like factories and shops and hospitals…
<v Neil> All non-religious buildings,
in other words!
<v Catherine> Exactly.
Now,
tell me Neil,
are you feeling <strong>grounded</strong> right now?
<v Neil> You’re asking if I’m thinking clearly and feeling connected to the world?
Do you even have to ask,
Catherine –
I’m a very <strong>grounded</strong> person.
<v Catherine> You are,
most of the time.
Most of the time you’re naturally <strong>grounded</strong>,
every now and again you get a bit panicked,
but …
some of us need to remember to slow down,
chill out and <strong>meditate</strong> once in a while.
<v Neil> Yes,
that would be <strong>meditate</strong> meaning to take quiet time to focus deeply on something.
<v Catherine> Exactly.

<v Neil> Yes,
focus only on our pages.
Don’t be distracted by anything else!
<v Both> Bye!
