<v Rob> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
I’m Rob…
<v Neil> And hello!
I’m Neil.
<v Rob> Hi there Neil.
Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?
<v Neil> Well I’m sitting right next to you,
Rob?
<v Rob> Very funny.
Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes,
and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>.
The difference is that monkeys have tails,
and apes don’t.
<v Neil> Well,
I didn’t know that.
On a serious note…
I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.
<v Rob> A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation.
So Neil,
what happened?
<v Neil> I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere,
blocking my path.
<v Rob> Oh goodness!
OK.
So what did you do?
<v Neil> After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me,
I turned round and walked back the way I came.
<v Rob> OK.
If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud,
high and unpleasant sound.
So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>,
then!
<v Neil> Absolutely!
Yes,
they did!
And a face-off,
by the way,
means an argument or fight.
<v Rob> Well,
today’s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make.
<strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia.
And while Neil’s monkeys screech unpleasantly,
gibbons sound like they are singing.
<v Neil> Musical apes –
that’s nice!
So how about today’s quiz question,
Rob?
<v Rob> OK,
good idea.
How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest?
Is it…
a) 500m
b) 1km
or c) 5km?
<v Neil> Hmm.
Well,
I have to guess and I’m going to say b) 1km.
<v Rob> You’ve never heard one.
<v Neil> Never heard one…
<v Rob> OK.
We’ll find out later on in the programme whether you’re right or wrong.
Now let’s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.
<v Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University> <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let’s just hear this.
[gibbons calling] That’s an absolutely wonderful,
evocative sound,
isn’t it?
Beautiful sound.
And what are they doing there then?
That is …
I said talking to each other.
<v Dr Clarke:> Well this is their…
They’re singing together.
So a male and a female,
when they hold a territory together,
will sing every morning what they call a duet.
All the groups…
<v Interviewer:> What we call a duet.
<v Dr Clarke:> Yes,
absolutely.
And they’ll all sing together at the same time,
and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.
<v Rob> So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound.
If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.
<v Neil> And something that is evocative is usually pleasant,
Rob.
<v Rob> It is.
And what’s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs –
one male and one female.
They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together.
So a duet is a song sung by two people –
or in this case,
sung by two gibbons!
<v Neil> And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time –
which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>.
Cacophony means a mix of loud noises,
which often sound out of tune.
<v Rob> And that could easily describe us singing together!
<v Neil> Let’s not do that.
<v Rob> But what’s the reason for the gibbon duets,
Neil?
<v Neil> Well,
the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female.
And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong> –
or bit of land –
belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.
<v Rob> Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong> –
or warn –
other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong> –
these are animals that eat other animals.
The gibbons use a quiet ‘hoo hoo’
call to communicate that a leopard is nearby,
and an even quieter ‘hoo hoo’
call for an eagle.
<v Neil> You’re very good at that Rob.
<v Rob> Thank you.
<v Neil> Now let’s hear more from Dr Clarke about this.
How does she describe language?
<v Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University> Yes,
so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates,
it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language.
<v Rob> Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>.
<v Neil> Right.
And ancestor means an animal –
or human –
from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from.
So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons –
then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.
<v Rob> Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations,
for example one call for ‘leopard’
and another for ‘eagle’.
<v Neil> And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.
<v Rob> OK,
let’s have the answer to the quiz question.
Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest?
Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?
<v Neil> And I said b) 1km.
<v Rob> And you were right!
A good guess!
Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons.
So well done!
Now,
can we hear today’s words again maybe in a gibbon’s voice Neil?
<v Neil> I’m not sure about that.
I’ll do it in a human voice.
