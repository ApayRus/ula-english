<v Rob> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
I’m Rob…
<v Neil> …and I’m Neil.
Hello.
<v Rob> Hello,
Neil!
You look pleased today,
Neil.
<v Neil> I am pleased.
I just moved into my new flat!
<v Rob> OK,
fantastic!
Congratulations!
Where is this new flat?
<v Neil> It’s in the city.
It’s a one-bed flat so it’s <strong>bijoux</strong> -
meaning small but attractive.
There’s a balcony,
I’ve got a couple of deckchairs,
and a barbecue…
<v Rob> I can’t wait to see it.
It sounds perfect.
Well,
today we’re discussing housing -
and why in some buildings there are separate entrances for rich and poor residents!
So,
are you ready for today’s quiz question,
Neil?
<v Neil> I’m all ears.
<v Rob> OK,
so you mean you’re listening carefully.
<v Neil> I am.
<v Rob> Right.
What does ‘social housing’ mean?
Is it housing for people who…
a) want to buy or rent at a low price?
b) want to live together sharing facilities?
or c) aren’t able to pay any rent at all?
<v Neil> OK,
I think the answer is a) to buy or rent at a low price.
<v Rob> OK.
Well,
we’ll see if you were right or wrong later on in the programme.
So,
have you met your neighbours yet,
Neil?
<v Neil> Yes -
I bumped into one couple as I was leaving for work this morning.
<v Rob> I see.
<strong>Bump into</strong> means to meet somebody by chance.
So were they friendly?
<v Neil> Well,
they complained about me blocking the communal area with my bike -
also about my guitar playing.
But apart from that,
they seemed nice!
<v Rob> A <strong>communal area</strong> is an area that is shared by a number of people.
Well,
I hate to say it,
Neil,
but your guitar playing is annoying!
<v Neil> Oh,
Rob,
genius isn’t appreciated here,
I think.
OK…
Let’s listen to the journalist Tom Bateman talking about rich and poor doors.
<v Tom Bateman, journalist> In front of us here is a 20-storey building.
Right about me I got tinted blue glass windows and balconies on every floor as you look from the street.
And there is a very plush foyer.
A sign in the window says ‘luxurious penthouses with spectacular views.’
<v Neil> But this is what the journalist Tom Bateman saw when he went around the other side of the same building.
<v Tom Bateman, journalist> So as you come down the side of the building,
you can see the windows -
quite small windows -
of the flats above here -
certainly no balconies.
This is a big grey concrete wall and as you walk down an alleyway towards the other door.
<v Rob> So this building has one entrance with a <strong>plush</strong> -
or expensive and luxurious -
foyer.
And <strong>foyer</strong> means entrance hall.
Then there’s another entrance down an <strong>alleyway</strong> -
or narrow passage between buildings.
<v Neil> This entrance leads to flats with small windows and no balconies.
Why’s that,
Rob?
<v Rob> That’s because the alleyway entrance is the so-called ‘poor door’.
There’ no swanky foyer or tinted glass windows for these residents because they pay less rent than the people living in the apartments at the front.
<v Neil> <strong>Swanky</strong> means something fashionable and expensive that is designed to impress people.
And <strong>tinted</strong> glass is coloured glass -
so people can’t look through your windows.
<v Rob> That sounds useful!
Do you have tinted glass windows,
Neil?
<v Neil> No,
I don’t.
Tinted sunglasses are all that I can afford.
So what do people think about having a rich door and a poor door for the same building,
Rob?
<v Rob> Well,
some people think it’s terrible.
They say it’s <strong>segregation</strong> -
or separation and different treatment of people -
and I can’t believe the poor-door people put up with it really!
<v Neil> <strong>To</strong> <strong>put up with something</strong> means to accept something that is annoying without complaining about it.
The thing is,
though,
the poor-door people don’t pay nearly as much rent.
And they don’t have to pay the same service charges that the rich-door people pay.
<v Rob> A <strong>service charge</strong> is an amount of money you pay to the owner of an apartment building for things like putting out the rubbish.
Well,
let’s listen to an experience of a poor-door resident.
<v Abdul Mohammed, resident of One Commercial St, City of London> We can’t use the lift…
because it’s for the rich people.
So whenever the doors open,
I use it.
So they try and tell me off for using it.
I say,
'here,
come,
take me to court -
I don’t mind’.
<v Neil> So what has Abdul been doing that the rich-door residents don’t like,
Rob?
<v Rob> Well,
he’s been using their lift because it’s near his apartment door.
<v Neil> And what does Abdul mean when he says,
'come,
take me to court’?
<v Rob> He’s inviting the rich-door residents to take legal action against him,
but Abdul doesn’t really think he’s doing anything wrong.
<v Neil> OK,
it’s time to hear the answer to today’s quiz question.
<v Rob> Yes.
What does ‘social housing’ mean?
Is it flats or houses for people…
a) who want to buy or rent at a low price?
b) who want to live together sharing facilities?
or c) who aren’t able to pay any rent at all?
<v Neil> And I said a) to buy or rent at a low price.
<v Rob> And you were right!
So well done for that,
Neil.
Now,

<v Neil> Good idea.
We heard:
