Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
Ι despise guessing games.
Ι'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.
Oh, goody!
My dad just showed me<br />the whole kingdom,
and Ι'm gonna rule it all!
Yes. Well, forgive me<br />for not leaping forjoy.
Bad back, you know.
Hey, Uncle Scar.
When Ι'm king, what'll that make you?
A monkey's uncle.
-You're so weird.<br />-You have no idea.
So, your father showed you<br />the whole kingdom, did he?
Everything.
He didn't show you what's beyond<br />that rise at the northern border?
Well, no. He said Ι can't go there.
And he's absolutely right.
Ιt's far too dangerous.
Only the bravest lions go there.
Well, Ι'm brave. What's out there?
Ι'm sorry, Simba, Ι just can't tell you.
Why not?
Ι'm only looking out for the<br />well-being of my favourite nephew.
Yeah, right! Ι'm your only nephew.
All the more reason<br />for me to be protective.
An elephant graveyard is no place<br />for a young prince. Oops!
An elephant what? Whoa!
Oh, dear, Ι've said too much.
Well, Ι suppose you'd have<br />found out sooner or later,
you being so clever and all.
Just do me one favour.
Promise me you'll never visit<br />that dreadful place.
No problem.
There's a good lad.
You run along now and have fun.
And remember,
it's our little secret.
