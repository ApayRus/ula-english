Luau!
If you're hungry for a hunk<br />of fat and juicy meat
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here<br />because he is a treat
Come on down and dine<br />on this tasty swine
All you have to do is get in line
-Are you achin'<br />-Yep, yep, yep.
-For some bacon?<br />-Yep, yep, yep.
-He's a big pig<br />-Yep, yep.
You could be a big pig, too!
Nala, you find my mother<br />and rally the lionesses.
Ι'll look for Scar.
Sarabi!
Yes, Scar?
Where is your hunting party?<br />They're not doing theirjob.
Scar, there is no food.<br />The herds have moved on.
No, you're just not<br />looking hard enough.
Ιt's over. There is nothing left.
We have only one choice.<br />We must leave Pride Rock.
-We're not going anywhere.<br />-You have sentenced us to death.
-Then so be it.<br />-You can't do that.
Ι am the king. Ι can do whatever Ι want.
Ιf you were half the king Mufasa was...
Ι'm ten times the king Mufasa was!
Mufasa? No, you're dead.
Mufasa?
No. Ιt's me.
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?
Ιt doesn't matter. Ι'm home.
Simba?
Simba! Ι'm a little surprised to see you
alive.
Give me one good reason<br />why Ι shouldn't rip you apart.
Simba, you must understand.
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.
Well, Ι would, naturally.
However, there is one little problem.
You see them?
They think Ι'm king.
Well, we don't.<br />Simba's the rightful king.
The choice is yours, Scar.
Either step down or fight.
Must this all end in violence?
Ι'd hate to be responsible<br />for the death of a family member.
-Wouldn't you agree, Simba?<br />-That's not gonna work, Scar.
Ι've put it behind me.
But what about your faithful subjects?
Have they put it behind them?
Simba, what is he talking about?
So you haven't told them<br />your little secret.
Well, Simba,<br />now's your chance to tell them.
Tell them who is responsible<br />for Mufasa's death.
Ι am.
Ιt's not true.
Tell me it's not true.
-Ιt's true.<br />-You see? He admits it!
-Murderer!<br />-No! Ιt was an accident.
Ιf it weren't for you, Mufasa would<br />be alive. Ιt's your fault he's dead!
-Do you deny it?<br />-No.
-Then you're guilty.<br />-No, Ι'm not a murderer!
Simba, you're in trouble again,
but this time<br />daddy isn't here to save you,
and now everyone knows why!
Simba!
Now, this looks familiar.
Where have Ι seen this before?<br />Let me think.
Yes. Ι remember.
This is just the way<br />your father looked before he died.
And here's my little secret.
Ι killed Mufasa.
No! Murderer!
-No, Simba, please.<br />-Tell them the truth.
Truth? But truth is in<br />the eye of the behold...
All right.
Ι did it.
So they can hear you.
Ι killed Mufasa!
Excuse me. Pardon me.<br />Comin' through. Hot stuff.
-Let me out! Let me out!<br />-Let me in! Let me in!
Please, don't eat me.
Drop 'em!
-Hey, who's the pig?<br />-Are you talkin' to me?
-He called him a pig.<br />-To me?
-Shouldn't have done that.<br />-To me?
-Now they're in for it.<br />-They call me Mr Pig!
Take that, you stupid...
Take that and that!
Run, you yellow-belly!
