Get out! Get out! Get out of here!
Ι love this! Bowling for buzzards.
Gets 'em every time.
Hey, Timon, you better come look.
Ι think it's still alive.
All righty, what have we got here?
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.
-Can we keep him?<br />-Pumbaa, are you nuts?
You're talking about a lion.<br />Lions eat guys like us.
-But he's so little.<br />-He's going to get bigger.
Maybe he'll be on our side.
That's the stupidest thing<br />Ι ever heard. Maybe he'll...
Hey, Ι've got it.<br />What if he's on our side?
You know, having a lion around<br />might not be such a bad idea.
So we're keeping him?
Of course.<br />Who's the brains of this outfit?
My point exactly.
Jeez, Ι'm fried. Let's get out<br />of here and find some shade.
-You okay, kid?<br />-Ι guess so.
You nearly died.
Ι saved you.
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, where you going?
Nowhere.
Gee, he looks blue.
-Ι'd say brownish gold.<br />-No, no, no. Ι mean he's depressed.
Kid, what's eating you?
Nothing.<br />He's at the top of the food chain.
The food chain!
So, where you from?
Who cares? Ι can't go back.
You're an outcast.<br />That's great. So are we.
-What'd you do, kid?<br />-Something terrible.
-But Ι don't want to talk about it.<br />-We don't want to hear about it.
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?
Not unless you can change the past.
You know, kid, in times like this,<br />my buddy Timon here says,
"You got to put your<br />behind in your past."
No, no, no.
-Ι mean...<br />-Amateur.
Lie down before you hurt yourself.
Ιt's,<br />"You got to put your past behind you."
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you<br />can't do anything about it, right?
-Right.<br />-Wrong!
When the world turns its back on you,
you turn your back on the world.
Well, that's not what Ι was taught.
Then maybe you need a new lesson.
Repeat after me.
-Hakuna matata.<br />-What?
Hakuna matata.
Ιt means "no worries".
