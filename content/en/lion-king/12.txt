Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.
But to lose Simba,<br />who had barely begun to live...
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.
So it is with a heavy heart<br />that Î™ assume the throne.
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy<br />we shall rise
to greet the dawning of a new era
in which lion and hyena come together
in a great and glorious future.
