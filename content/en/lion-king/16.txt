-Whoa! Nice one, Simba.<br />-Thanks.
-Man, Ι'm stuffed.<br />-Me, too.
Ι ate like a pig.
Pumbaa, you are a pig.
Right.
-Timon?<br />-Yeah?
Ever wonder what those<br />sparkling dots are up there?
Pumbaa, Ι don't wonder, Ι know.
What are they?
They're fireflies.
Fireflies that got stuck<br />up in that big bluish-black thing.
Gee.
Ι always thought they were balls of gas
burning billions of miles away.
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.
Simba, what do you think?
Well, Ι don't know.
Come on. Give, give, give, give.
Come on. We told you ours. Please?
Well...
Somebody once told me
that the great kings of the past<br />are up there watching over us.
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys<br />are watching us?
-Who told you something like that?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
-What mook made that up?<br />-Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?
-You're killing me.<br />-Yeah.
Was it something Ι said?
