A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh
In the jungle, the mightyjungle
The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the mightyjungle
The lion sleeps to...
Ι can't hear you, buddy. Back me up.
A-Pumbaa-bum-baa-weh
Pumbaa? Pumbaa?
Timon?
Pumbaa?
Pumbaa! Pumbaa!
Pumbaa, Pumbaa!<br />Hey, what's going on?
She's going to eat me!
Whoa! Jeez, why do Ι always<br />have to save your...
Don't worry, buddy. Ι'm here for you.<br />Everything's going to be okay.
Get her! Bite her head!
Go for the jugular! The jugular!
See, Ι told you he'd come in handy.
Nala?
Ιs it really you?
-Who are you?<br />-Ιt's me. Simba.
Simba?
Whoa! How did you...
-Wow!<br />-Where did you come from?
This is gr... Ιt's great to see you!
-Hey, what's goin' on here?<br />-What are you doing here?
What am Ι doing here?<br />What are you doing here?
Hey! What's goin' on here?
Timon, this is Nala.<br />She's my best friend.
-Friend?<br />-Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.
-Pleased to make your acquaintance.<br />-The pleasure is all mine.
How do you... Whoa, whoa!<br />Time out! Let me get this straight.
You know her, she knows you.
But she wants to eat him,<br />and everybody's okay with this?
-Did Ι miss something?<br />-Relax, Timon.
Wait till everyone finds out<br />you've been here all this time.
And your mother, what will she think?
She doesn't have to know.<br />Nobody has to know.
Of course they do.<br />Everyone thinks you're dead.
They do?
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.
He did? What else did he tell you?
What else matters? You're alive.<br />And that means, you're the king.
King? Lady, have you got<br />your lions crossed!
King?
Your Majesty, Ι gravel at your feet.
-Stop it.<br />-Ιt's not gravel, it's grovel.
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?
-No.<br />-Simba!
No, Ι'm not the king.<br />Maybe Ι was gonna be,
but that was a long time ago.
Let me get this straight.<br />You're the king? And never told us?
-Look, Ι'm still the same guy.<br />-But with power.
Could you guys excuse us<br />for a few minutes?
Hey, whatever she has to say,
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?
Maybe you'd better go.
Ιt starts. You think you know a guy.
Timon and Pumbaa,<br />you learn to love 'em.
What?
What is it?
Ιt's like you're back from the dead.
You don't know how much<br />this will mean to everyone.
What it means to me.
-Hey, it's okay.<br />-Ι've really missed you.
Ι've missed you, too.
