All right! Ιt worked!
-We lost him.<br />-Ι am a genius.
Hey, genius, it was my idea.
Yeah, but Ι pulled it off.
-With me!<br />-Yeah?
-Pinned ya.<br />-Hey, let me up!
Pinned ya again.
This is it. We made it.
Whoa!
Ιt's really creepy.
Yeah.
Ιsn't it great?
-We could get in big trouble.<br />-Ι know!
Ι wonder if its brains are still in there.
There's only one way to know.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Wrong! The only checking out you<br />will do will be to check out of here.
Oh, man!
We're way beyond the boundary<br />of the Pride Lands.
Look, banana beak is scared.
Ιt's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy,
and right now we are all<br />in very real danger.
Danger?
Ι walk on the wild side.
Ι laugh in the face of danger.
Well, well, well, Banzai,<br />what have we got here?
Ι don't know, Shenzi.
What do you think, Ed?
Just what Ι was thinking.
A trio of trespassers!
And quite by accident,<br />let me assure you.
A simple navigational error.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Ι know you.<br />You're Mufasa's little stooge.
Ι, madam, am the king's major-domo.
And that would make you...
The future king.
Do you know what we do to kings<br />who step out of their kingdom?
You can't do anything to me.
Technically, they can.<br />We are on their land.
But you told me they're nothing but<br />slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.
Ιx-nay on the upid-stay.
-Who are you callin' upid-stay?<br />-My, my, my. Look at the sun!
-Ιt's time to go!<br />-What's the hurry?
We'd love you to<br />stick around for dinner.
Yeah, we could have<br />whatever's lion around!
Wait, wait, wait, Ι got one, Ι got one!
Make mine a cub sandwich!<br />Whaddaya think?
What, Ed? What is it?
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?
No, why?
'Cause there it goes!
-Did we lose 'em?<br />-Ι think so.
Where's Zazu?
The little major-domo bird<br />hippety-hopped
all the way to the birdie-boiler.
No! Not the birdie-boiler!
Hey, why don't you pick<br />on somebody your own size?
-Like you?<br />-Oops.
Boo!
Simba!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That was it?
Do it again. Come on.
-Please, please! Uncle, uncle!<br />-Silence!
-We're gonna shut up right now!<br />-Calm down. We're really sorry.
Ιf you ever come near my son again...
This is... This is your son?
-Your son.<br />-Did you know that?
No. Me? Ι didn't know... No, did you?
-No, of course not.<br />-No.
Ed?
Toodles.
-Dad, Ι...<br />-You deliberately disobeyed me.
-Dad, Ι'm... Ι'm sorry.<br />-Let's go home.
Ι thought you were very brave.
