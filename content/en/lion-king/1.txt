From the day we arrive
On the planet
And, blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see
Than can ever be seen
More to do
Than can ever be done
There's far too much
To take in here
More to find
Than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small
On the endless round
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
ln the circle
The circle of life
lt's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
ln the circle
The circle of life
