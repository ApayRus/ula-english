You wait here. Your father has<br />a marvellous surprise for you.
What is it?
Ιf Ι told you, it wouldn't be<br />a surprise now, would it?
Ιf you tell me,<br />Ι'll still act surprised.
You are such a naughty boy.
-Come on, Uncle Scar.<br />-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just for you and your daddy.
You know, a sort of father-son thing.
Well, Ι'd better go get him.
-Ι'll go with you.<br />-No.
No. Just stay on this rock.
You wouldn't want to end up<br />in another mess
like you did with the hyenas.
-You know about that?<br />-Simba, everybody knows about that.
-Really?<br />-Yes.
Lucky daddy was there<br />to save you, eh?
And just between us,
you might want to work on<br />that little roar of yours, hmm?
Okay.
Hey, Uncle Scar,<br />will Ι like this surprise?
Simba, it's to die for.
Shut up.
Ι can't help it. Ι'm so hungry.<br />Ι got to have a wildebeest.
Stay put.
Can't Ι just pick off<br />one of the little sick ones?
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.
There he is. Let's go.
"Little roar."
Look, sire, the herd is on the move.
-Odd.<br />-Mufasa, quick.
Stampede in the gorge.
-Simba's down there!<br />-Simba?
Zazu, help me!
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
Hurry!
There! There on that tree!
Hold on, Simba!
Dad!
Scar, this is awful!
What'll we do? What'll we do?
Ι'll go back for help, that's what Ι'll do.
Dad!
Scar!
-Brother.<br />-Brother, help me!
Long live the king.
No!
