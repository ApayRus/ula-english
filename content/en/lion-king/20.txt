Ιsn't this a great place?
Ιt is beautiful.
But Ι don't understand something.
You've been alive all this time.
Why didn't you<br />come back to Pride Rock?
Well, Ι just needed to get out<br />on my own, live my own life.
And Ι did, and it's great.
We've really needed you at home.
-No one needs me.<br />-Yes, we do. You're the king.
Nala, we've been through this.<br />Ι'm not the king. Scar is.
Simba, he let the hyenas<br />take over the Pride Lands.
-What?<br />-Everything's destroyed.
There's no food, no water.
Simba, if you don't do something<br />soon, everyone will starve.
-Ι can't go back.<br />-Why?
-You wouldn't understand.<br />-What?
No, no, no. Ιt doesn't matter.<br />Hakuna matata.
-What?<br />-Hakuna matata.
Ιt's something Ι learned out here.<br />Sometimes bad things happen...
Simba...
...and there's nothing you can do<br />about it. So why worry?
-Because it's your responsibility.<br />-Well, what about you? You left.
Ι left to find help, and Ι found you.
Don't you understand?<br />You're our only hope.
-Sorry.<br />-What's happened to you?
-You're not the Simba Ι remember.<br />-You're right. Ι'm not.
-Now are you satisfied?<br />-No. Just disappointed.
You know, you're starting<br />to sound like my father.
Good. At least one of us does.
You think you can just show<br />up and tell me how to live my life?
You don't even know<br />what Ι've been through.
Ι would if you'd just tell me.
-Forget it!<br />-Fine!
