Hakuna matata?
-Yeah. Ιt's our motto.<br />-What's a motto?
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?
You know, kid, these two words<br />will solve all your problems.
That's right.<br />Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...
When he was a young warthog
When I was a young warthog
-Very nice.<br />-Thanks.
He found his aroma<br />lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savanna<br />after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul
Though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends<br />never stood downwind
-And, oh, the shame<br />-He was ashamed
-Thought of changing my name<br />-Oh, what's in a name?
And I got downhearted
-How did you feel?<br />-Every time that I...
-Hey, not in front of the kids.<br />-Oh, sorry.

Philosophy
Hakuna matata
Welcome to our humble home.
-You live here?<br />-We live wherever we want.
Yep. Home is where your rump rests.
Ιt's beautiful.
Ι'm starved.
Ι'm so hungry Ι could eat a whole zebra.
We're fresh out of zebra.
Any antelope?
-Hippo?<br />-Nope.
Listen, kid, if you live with us,<br />you have to eat like us.
Hey, this looks like a good spot<br />to rustle up some grub.
What's that?
A grub. What's it look like?
Gross.
Tastes like chicken.
Slimy yet satisfying.
These are rare delicacies.
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.
You'll learn to love them.
Ι'm telling you, kid, this is the great life,
no rules, no responsibilities.
The little cream-filled kind.
And best of all, no worries.
Well, kid?
Oh, well. Hakuna matata.
Slimy, yet satisfying.
That's it.
