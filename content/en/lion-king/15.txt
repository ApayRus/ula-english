Nobody knows
The trouble I've seen
Nobody knows
My sorrow
Zazu, do lighten up.
Sing something with a little bounce in it.
It's a small world after all
No, no! Anything but that!
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts

Ι would never have had<br />to do this with Mufasa.
What? What did you say?

-Hey, boss.<br />-What is it this time?
-We got a bone to pick with you.<br />-Ι'll handle this.
Scar, there's no food, no water.
Yeah. Ιt's dinner time<br />and we ain't got no stinking entrées.
Ιt's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
-Eat Zazu.<br />-You wouldn't want me.
Ι'd be so tough and gamey and...
Zazu, don't be ridiculous.<br />All you need is a little garlic.
Ι thought things<br />were bad under Mufasa.
-What did you say?<br />-Ι said Muf...
Ι said qué pasa?
Good. Now get out.
But we're still hungry.
Out!
