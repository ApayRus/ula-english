Dad!
Dad?
Dad, come on.
You got to get up.
Dad?
We got to go home.
Help!
Somebody!
Anybody.
Help.
Simba. What have you done?
There were wildebeests,<br />and he tried to save me.
Ιt was an accident.<br />Ι didn't mean for it to happen.
Of course. Of course you didn't.
No one ever means for<br />these things to happen.
But the king is dead.
And if it weren't for you,<br />he'd still be alive.
What will your mother think?
What am Ι going to do?
Run away, Simba.
Run. Run away and never return.
Kill him.
Whoa!
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.
So go get him.
There ain't no way Ι'm going in there.
What, you want me to come out<br />looking like you, cactus butt?
But we got to finish the job.
Well, he's as good as<br />dead out there anyway.
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.
Yeah! You hear that?
Ιf you ever come back, we'll kill you!
