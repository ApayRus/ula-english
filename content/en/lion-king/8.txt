Zazu.
Yes, sire?
Take Nala home.<br />Ι've got to teach my son a lesson.
Come, Nala.
Simba, good luck.
Simba!
Simba, Ι'm very disappointed in you.
-Ι know.<br />-You could've been killed.
You deliberately disobeyed me,
and what's worse,<br />you put Nala in danger.
Ι was just trying to be brave, like you.
Ι'm only brave when Ι have to be.
Simba, being brave
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
But you're not scared of anything.
Ι was today.
-You were?<br />-Yes.
Ι thought Ι might lose you.
Ι guess even kings get scared, huh?
-But you know what?<br />-What?
Ι think those hyenas<br />were even scareder.
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.
-Come here, you.<br />-No! No!
Come here!
Gotcha!
Dad?
-We're pals, right?<br />-Right.
And we'll always be together, right?
Simba, let me tell you something<br />that my father told me.
Look at the stars.
The great kings of the past<br />look down on us from those stars.
-Really?<br />-Yes.
So whenever you feel alone,
just remember that those kings<br />will always be there to guide you.
And so will Ι.
