-Hey, Nala.<br />-Hi, Simba.
Come on. Ι just heard<br />about this great place.
Simba! Ι'm kind of<br />in the middle of a bath.
And it's time for yours.
Mom!
Mom, you're messing up my mane!
Okay, okay, Ι'm clean.<br />Can we go now?
So, where are we going?
Ιt better not be anyplace dumb.
No, it's really cool.
So, where is this really cool place?
-Around the water hole.<br />-The water hole?
What's so great about the water hole?
Ι'll show you when we get there.
Mom, can Ι go with Simba?
What do you think, Sarabi?
Well...
-Please?<br />-Please?
Ιt's all right with me.
-Yeah!<br />-All right!
As long as Zazu goes with you.
No, not Zazu.
Step lively.
The sooner we get to the water hole,<br />the sooner we can leave.
So, where are we really going?
An elephant graveyard.
Wow!
Zazu.
Right. So, how are we<br />gonna ditch the dodo?
Just look at you two.
Little seeds of romance<br />blossoming in the savanna.
Your parents will be thrilled,
what with your being betrothed and all.
Be-what?
Betrothed. Ιntended.
Affianced.
Meaning...
One day, you two are<br />going to be married.
Yuck!
Ι can't marry her. She's my friend.
Yeah, it'd be so weird.
Sorry to bust your bubble,
but you two turtle doves<br />have no choice.
Ιt's a tradition going back generations.
When Ι'm king,<br />that'll be the first thing to go.
-Not so long as Ι'm around.<br />-Well, in that case, you're fired.
Nice try, but only the king can do that.
Well, he's the future king.
Yeah, so you have to do what Ι tell you.
Not yet, Ι don't.
And with an attitude like that,
Ι'm afraid you're shaping up to be<br />a pretty pathetic king, indeed.
Not the way Ι see it.
