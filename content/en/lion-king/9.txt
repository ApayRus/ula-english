Man, that lousy Mufasa.<br />Ι won't be able to sit for a week.
Ιt's not funny, Ed.
Hey, shut up!
Will you knock it off?
-Well, he started it.<br />-Look at you guys.
No wonder we're dangling<br />at the bottom of the food chain.
Man, Ι hate dangling.
Yeah? Ιf it weren't for those lions,<br />we'd be runnin' the joint.
Man, Ι hate lions.
-So pushy.<br />-And hairy.
-And stinky.<br />-And, man, are they...
Ugly!
Surely we lions are not all that bad.
Scar. Ιt's just you.
We were afraid it was<br />somebody important.
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.
-Yeah.<br />-Ι see.
-Now that's power!<br />-Tell me about it.
Ι just hear that name and Ι shudder.
-Mufasa!<br />-Do it again.
Mufasa!
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!
Ιt tingles me.
Ι'm surrounded by idiots.
Now, you, Scar, Ι mean, you're<br />one of us. Ι mean, you're our pal.
Charmed.
Ι like that. He's not king,<br />but he's still so proper.
Yeah. Hey, did you<br />bring us anything to eat,
Scar, old buddy, old pal?<br />Huh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?
Ι don't think you really deserve this.
Ι practically gift-wrapped<br />those cubs for you,
and you couldn't even dispose of them.
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly<br />like they was alone, Scar.
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?
Kill Mufasa?
Precisely.
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings<br />and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher
l know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared
Yeah, be prepared.<br />We'll be prepared. For what?
For the death of the king.
-Why, is he sick?<br />-No, fool, we're going to kill him.
-And Simba, too.<br />-Great idea. Who needs a king?
No king, no king
-Ιdiots! There will be a king!<br />-Hey, but you said...
Ι will be king!
Stick with me,
and you'll never go hungry again.
-Yeah! All right!<br />-Long live the king!
Long live the king! Long live the king!
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo<br />you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasise is
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder l am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared
