Î™ tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.
Sorry.
Not you! Them!
Him, her, alone.
What's wrong with that?
-I can see what's happening<br />-What?
-And they don't have a clue<br />-Who?
They'll fall in love<br />and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this<br />romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once
In perfect harmony
With all its living things
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past?
Impossible, she'd turn away from me
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, l can't decide
Why won't he be<br />the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once
In perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through
The night's uncertainties
Love is where they are
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days
With us are history
In short, our pal
Is doomed
