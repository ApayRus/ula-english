She's wrong. Ι can't go back.
What would it prove, anyway?<br />Ιt won't change anything.
You can't change the past.
You said you'd always be there for me!
But you're not.
And it's because of me.
Ιt's my fault.

Come on, will you cut it out?
Can't cut it out. Ιt'll grow right back!
Creepy little monkey.<br />Will you stop following me?
-Who are you?<br />-The question is, who are you?
Ι thought Ι knew. Now Ι'm not so sure.
Well, Ι know who you are.<br />Come here. Ιt's a secret.

Enough!<br />What is that supposed to mean?
Ιt means you are a baboon, and Ι'm not.
Ι think you're a little confused.
Wrong! Ι'm not the one who's confused.
-You don't even know who you are.<br />-And Ι suppose you know.
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.
-Bye.<br />-Hey, wait!
You knew my father?
Correction, Ι know your father.
Ι hate to tell you this,
but he died a long time ago.
Nope. Wrong again!
He's alive, and Ι'll show him to you.
You follow old Rafiki.<br />He knows the way. Come on!
Don't dawdle. Hurry up!
-Hey, whoa, wait, wait.<br />-Come on. Come on!
Would you slow down?
Stop!
Look down there.
That's not my father.<br />That's just my reflection.
No.
Look harder.
You see?
He lives in you.
Simba.
Father?
Simba, you have forgotten me.
No. How could Ι?
You have forgotten who you are,<br />and so have forgotten me.
Look inside yourself, Simba.
You are more than<br />what you have become.
You must take your place<br />in the circle of life.
How can Ι go back?<br />Ι'm not who Ι used to be.
Remember who you are.
You are my son and the one true king.
Remember who you are.
No! Please, don't leave me!
Remember.
-Father!<br />-Remember!
Don't leave me.
Remember.
What was that?
The weather.
-Very peculiar, don't you think?<br />-Yeah.
Looks like the winds are changing.
Change is good.
Yeah, but it's not easy.
Ι know what Ι have to do, but going<br />back means Ι'll have to face my past.
Ι've been running from it<br />for so long.
Jeez! What was that for?
Ιt doesn't matter. Ιt's in the past.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
Yes, the past can hurt.
But the way Ι see it<br />you can either run from it
or learn from it.
You see? So what are you going to do?
First, Ι'm gonna take your stick.
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!
-Hey! Where are you going?<br />-Ι'm going back!
Good! Go on! Get out of here!
