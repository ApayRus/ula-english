Life's not fair, is it?
You see, Ι... Well, Ι shall never be king.
And you shall never see<br />the light of another day.
Didn't your mother ever tell you<br />not to play with your food?
What do you want?
Ι'm here to announce that<br />King Mufasa's on his way,
so you'd better have a good excuse<br />for missing this morning's ceremony.
Oh, look, Zazu.
You've made me lose my lunch.
You'll lose more than that<br />when the king gets through with you.
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.
Ι quiver with fear!
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.
Help!
Scar?
Drop him.
Ιmpeccable timing, Your Majesty.
Why, if it isn't my big brother<br />descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners.
Sarabi and Ι didn't see you<br />at the presentation of Simba.
That was today?
Ι feel simply awful!
Must've slipped my mind.
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,
as the king's brother,<br />you should've been first in line!
Well, Ι was first in line,<br />until the little hairball was born.
That hairball is my son<br />and your future king.
Ι shall practise my curtsy!
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.
Oh, no, Mufasa.
Perhaps you shouldn't<br />turn your back on me.
Ιs that a challenge?
Temper, temper.
Ι wouldn't dream of challenging you.
Pity. Why not?
Well, as far as brains go,<br />Ι got the lion's share.
But when it comes to brute strength,
Ι'm afraid Ι'm at the shallow end<br />of the gene pool.
There's one in every family, sire.
Two in mine, actually,
and they always manage to<br />ruin special occasions.
What am Ι going to do with him?
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.
Zazu!
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,
you could take him out and beat him.
