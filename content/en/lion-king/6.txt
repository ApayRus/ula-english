I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware
Well, l've never seen<br />a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before
I'm brushin' up on lookin' down
I'm workin' on my roar
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, l just can't wait to be king
You've rather a long way to go,<br />young master, if you think...
-No one sayin', "Do this"<br />-Now, when l said that...
-No one saying, "Be there"<br />-What l meant was...
-No one sayin', "Stop that"<br />-You don't realise...
-No one sayin', "See here"<br />-Now, see here!
Free to run around all day
Well, that's definitely out.
Free to do it all my way
I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart--to-heart
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
If this is where<br />the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting<br />wildly out of wing
Oh, l just can't wait to be king
Everybody, look left
Everybody, look right
Everywhere you look, I'm
Standing in the spotlight
Not yet!
Let every creature<br />go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd<br />and on the wing
It's gonna be<br />King Simba's finest fling
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait
To be king
Î™ beg your pardon, madam, but
get off!
Simba?
Nala!
