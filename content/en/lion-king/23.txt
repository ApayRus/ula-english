Simba, wait up!
-Ιt's awful, isn't it?<br />-Ι didn't want to believe you.
What made you come back?
Ι finally got some sense<br />knocked into me,
and Ι've got the bump to prove it.
Besides, this is my kingdom.
Ιf Ι don't fight for it, who will?
-Ι will.<br />-Ιt's gonna be dangerous.
Danger? Ι laugh in the face of danger.
Ι see nothing funny about this.
Timon! Pumbaa!<br />What are you doing here?
At your service, my liege.
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?
Yes, Timon. This is my home.
Talk about your fixer-upper!
Well, Simba, if it's important to<br />you, we're with you to the end.
Hyenas. Ι hate hyenas.
So what's your plan<br />for getting past those guys?
-Live bait.<br />-Good idea. Hey!
Come on, Timon. You guys<br />have to create a diversion.
What do you want me to do,<br />dress in drag and do the hula?
