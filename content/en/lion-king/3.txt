Simba.
Dad! Dad!
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!
Sorry.
Dad! Dad!
Your son is awake.
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Dad! Come on, Dad.
You promised.
Okay, Okay. Ι'm up, Ι'm up.
Yeah!
Look, Simba.
Everything the light<br />touches is our kingdom.
Wow.
A king's time as ruler<br />rises and falls like the sun.
One day, Simba,<br />the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you as the new king.
-And this'll all be mine?<br />-Everything.
Everything the light touches.
What about that shadowy place?
That's beyond our borders.
You must never go there, Simba.
But Ι thought a king<br />can do whatever he wants.
Oh, there's more to being king<br />than getting your way all the time.
-There's more?<br />-Simba...
Everything you see exists together<br />in a delicate balance.
As king, you need to<br />understand that balance
and respect all the creatures,
from the crawling ant<br />to the leaping antelope.
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.
When we die, our bodies<br />become the grass,
and the antelope eat the grass.
And so we are all connected<br />in the great circle of life.
-Good morning, sire!<br />-Good morning, Zazu.
Checking in with the morning report.
Fire away.
Well! The buzz from the bees
is that the leopards<br />are in a bit of a spot.
Really?
What are you doing, son?
Pouncing.
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
Ι told the elephants to forget it,<br />but they can't...
-Zazu, would you turn around?<br />-Yes, sire.
The cheetahs are hard up, but...
Stay low to the ground.
Cheetahs never prosper...
Yeah, okay.<br />Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.
-What going on?<br />-A pouncing lesson.
Very good. Pouncing.
Pouncing?<br />No, sire, you can't be serious...
This is so humiliating.
Try not to make a sound.
What are you telling him, Mufasa?
Mufasa? Simba?
That's very good.
-Zazu!<br />-Yes!
-News from the underground.<br />-Now, this time...
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!
Zazu, take Simba home.
Dad, can't Ι come?
No, son.
Ι never get to go anywhere.
Young master,<br />one day, you will be king.
Then you can chase those<br />slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers
from dawn until dusk.
