Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful, baby
And did your granny say
Listen to your heart
Be who you are on the inside
I need three words<br />To tear her argument apart
Your granny lied
I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure<br />From a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck<br />And make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a<br />Wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec<br />Don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb<br />They chase anything that glitters
Beginners
Oh, and here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
Mm, fish dinners
I just love free food
And you look like seafood
MAUI: Hey, crab cake!
I'm back.
It's Maui Time!
(GASPS)
What do you say, little buddy?
Giant hawk? Coming up!
Cheeeehoooo!
Cheeeehoooo!
Well, well, well.
Little Maui's having<br />trouble with his look
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch What a terrible performance
Get the hook<br />Get it?
You don't swing it<br />Like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you<br />Credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you<br />I made myself a work of art
I 'll never hide<br />I can't
I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle<br />Like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff<br />My stuff is so shiny
Send your armies<br />But they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough<br />Maui, man
You can try, try, try<br />But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod<br />Look it up
You Will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your achin' heart
Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough
But your armor's just not hard enough
Maui<br />Now it's time to kick your heinie
Ever seen someone so shiny
Soak it in<br />Cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie<br />Mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I eat you so<br />prepare your final plea
Just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny
