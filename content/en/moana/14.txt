Mother...
TUI: What can be done?
(VILLAGERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
(WEAKLY) Go.
Gramma.
Go.
Not now. I can't.
You must!
The ocean chose you.
Follow the fish hook.
Gramma...
And when you find Maui...
you grab him by the ear. You say...
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...
sail across the sea...
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
(VOICE BREAKING) I can't leave you.
There is nowhere you could go<br />that I won't be with you.
Go!
