(CLUCKING)
(CAWS IN ALARM)
Whew!
Um...
What?
I said help me!
And wrecking my boat?
Not helping!
Fish pee in you all day!
So...
(HEIHEI CLUCKING)
Maui?
Maui!
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat.
No. You will board my boat.
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my...
Boat! A boat!
The gods have given me a...
(SCREAMING)
(MOANA CLEARS THROAT)
Maui, shapeshifter...
demigod of the wind and sea...
-- I am Moana of...<br />-- Hero of men.
What?
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,<br />demigod of the wind and sea...
hero of men.
I interrupted.<br />From the top. Hero of men. Go.
I am...
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
And women. Men and women.
Both. All.
Not a guy, girl thing.
You know, Maui is a hero to all.
You're doing great.<br />(CLICKS TONGUE)
What? No! I'm here to...
Of course.
Yes, yes, yes.
Maui always has time for his fans.
When you use a bird to write with...
it's called tweeting.
(CHUCKLES) I know, not every day<br />you get a chance to meet your hero.
You are not my hero.
And I'm not here<br />so you can sign my oar!
I'm here 'cause<br />you stole the heart of Te Fiti!
And you will board my boat...
and sail across the sea and put it back!
Um...
Yeah, it almost sounded<br />like you don't like me...
which is impossible because...
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...
trying to get the heart<br />as a gift for you mortals.
So you could have the power<br />to create life itself.
Yeah. So, what I believe<br />you were trying to say...
is "thank you."
-- "Thank you?"<br />-- You're welcome.
What? No, no, no!
I didn't... I wasn't...
Why would I ever say that?
Okay, okay.
