Te Fiti!
(HEIHEI SCREECHING)
The chicken lives.
I'm sorry about your hook.
Well, hook, no hook...
I'm Maui.
(GASPS) Te Fiti!
(LAUGHING SHEEPISHLY)
Hey, I mean, how you been?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Look, what I did was...
wrong.
I have no excuse.
I'm sorry.
(GASPS)
You know, it'd be rude to refuse<br />a gift from a goddess.
Cheeeehoooo!
Thank you.
Your kind gesture is<br />deeply appreciated.
Cheeeehoooo.
