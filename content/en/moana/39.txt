17.89 20.06 We set a course to find
20.23 24.48 A brand new island<br />everywhere we roam
26.78 29.15 We keep our island in our mind
29.69 33.91 And when it's time to find home<br />We know the way
35.62 38.62 We are explorers reading every sign
39.25 43.46 We tell the stories of our elders<br />In a never-ending chain
51.05 55.72 We know the way
