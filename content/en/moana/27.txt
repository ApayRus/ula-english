(THUDDING)
We're alive!
We're alive!
Listen...
I appreciate what you did down there.
Mm-hmm.
-- Took guts.<br />-- Mm-hmm.
-- But...<br />-- Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be sincere for once,<br />and it feels like you're distracted.
No, no. No way!
Really? Because you're looking at me<br />like I have a...
(GASPS)
shark head.
What? Do you have a shark head?
Look, the point is...
for a little girl, child, thing,<br />whatever...
who had no business<br />being down there...
you did me a solid.
But you also almost died.
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.
So, chances of beating Te Kā?
Bupkis.
We're never making it to Te Fiti.<br />This mission is cursed.
It's not cursed.
Shark head.
It is not cursed.
(GROANS)
Cursed.
What can I say except
We're dead soon
We're dead soon
Can you at least try?
Giant hawk.
Hey, it's okay, it's okay<br />We're dead soon
All right, break time's over.
Get up.
Why? Are you gonna give me a speech?
Tell me I can beat Te Kā<br />cause I'm "Maui?"
Take a hike, Tiny.
How do you get your tattoos?
They show up. When I earn them.
How'd you earn that one?<br />What's that for?
That's man's discovery of Nunya.
What's Nunya?
Nunya business.
I'll just keep asking.
What's it for?
You need to stop doing that.
-- Back off.<br />-- Just tell me what it is.
I said back off.
Is it why your hook's not working?
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.
You wanna throw me off the boat...
throw me off.
You wanna tell me<br />I don't know what I'm doing...
I know I don't.
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.
You're right.
But my island is dying...
so I am here.
It's just me and you.
And I want to help...
but I can't if you don't let me.
