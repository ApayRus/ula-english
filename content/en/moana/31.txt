Why did you bring me here?
I'm not the right person.
You have to choose someone else.
Choose someone else.
Please.
(SOBBING)
No.
GRAMMA: You're a long ways<br />past the reef.
Gramma?
Guess I chose the right tattoo.
Gramma!
I tried, Gramma.
I couldn't do it.
It's not your fault.
I never should have put so much<br />on your shoulders.
If you are ready to go home...
I will be with you.
Why do you hesitate?
I don't know.
