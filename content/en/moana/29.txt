What?
I figured it out.
You know, the ocean used to love<br />when I pulled up islands...
cause your ancestors<br />would sail her seas and find 'em.
All those new lands, new villages.
It was the water that connected 'em all.
And if I were the ocean...
I think I'd be looking for<br />a curly-haired non-princess...
to start that again.
That is literally the nicest thing<br />you've ever said to me.
Probably should have saved it<br />for Te Fiti.
I did.
Moana of Motunui...
I believe you have officially<br />delivered Maui across the great sea.
Moana! Moana! Moana!
You're so amazing!
It's time.
Go save the world.
Cheeeehoooo!

Maui!
What are you doing?
Finding you a better way in!
-- We won't make it!<br />-- Yes, we will!
-- Turn around!<br />-- No!
Moana, stop!
No!
