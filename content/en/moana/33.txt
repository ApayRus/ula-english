(GRUNTS)
I am Moana of Motunui.
Aboard my boat...
I will sail across the sea...
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
Te KƒÅ can't follow us into the water.
We make it past the barrier islands...
we make it to Te Fiti.
None of which you understand...
-- because you are a chicken.<br />-- (CLUCKING)

No!
Heihei! No, no, no!
Nice work!
Te Fiti.
