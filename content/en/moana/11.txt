(ETHEREAL VOICES ECHOING)
(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
We read the wind and the sky
When the sun is high
We sail the length of the seas
On the ocean breeze
At night we name every star
We know where we are
We know who we are<br />Who we are
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way
We are explorers reading every sign
We tell the stories of our elders<br />In a never-ending chain
We know the way
