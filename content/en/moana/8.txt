I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try
Every turn I take<br />Every trail I track
Every path I make<br />Every road leads back
To the place I know<br />Where I cannot go
Where I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows
How far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea<br />Stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go, there's just no telling<br />how far I'll go
I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
(SQUEALS)
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride<br />I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied<br />If I play along
But the voice inside<br />Sings a different song
What is wrong with me
See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows
How deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line<br />Will I cross that line
The line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows
How far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea<br />stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go
