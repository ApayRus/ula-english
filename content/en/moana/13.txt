VILLAGER 1: The crops are turning black.
VILLAGER 2: What about the fish?
VILLAGER 3: This is happening all over the island.
-- Please, please settle down.<br />-- What are you going to do?
We will dig new fields.<br />We will find a way to...
We can stop the darkness!<br />Save our island!
There's a cavern of boats.
Huge canoes.
We can take them, find Maui,<br />make him restore the heart.
We were voyagers.<br />We can voyage again!
You told me to help our people.
This is how we help our people.
Dad?
What are you doing?
I should've burned those boats a long time ago!
No! Don't!
We have to find Maui.<br />We have to restore the heart!
There is no heart!
This is just a rock!
No!
(HORN BLOWING)
Chief! It's your mother!
