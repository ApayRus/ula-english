(BOTH SCREAMING)
Are you okay?
Maui?
I told you to turn back.
I thought we could make it.
We?
I thought I could make it.
We can fix it.
It was made by the gods.
You can't fix it!
Next time we'll be more careful.
Te KƒÅ was stuck on the barrier islands.
It's lava, it can't go in the water.
We can find a way around.
I'm not going back.
We still have to restore the heart.
My hook is cracked.
One more hit, and it's over.
Maui, you have to restore the heart.
Without my hook, I am nothing.
That's not true!
Without my hook, I am nothing!
(SHUDDERING)
We are only here...
because you stole the heart in the first place.
No, we're here because<br />the ocean told you you're special...
and you believed it.
I am Moana of Motunui.
-- You will board my boat...<br />-- Goodbye, Moana.
...sail across the sea...
I'm not killing myself...
so you can prove you're something you're not!
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!
The ocean chose me!
It chose wrong.
Maui!
