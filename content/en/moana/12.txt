We were voyagers.
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!
Why'd we stop?
Maui.
When he stole from the mother island,<br />darkness fell.
Te KƒÅ awoke.
Monsters lurked<br />and boats stopped coming back.
To protect our people,<br />the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...
and now we have forgotten who we are.
And the darkness<br />has continued to spread...
chasing away our fish...
draining the life...
from island after island.
Our island.
But, one day...
someone will journey beyond our reef,<br />find Maui...
deliver him across the great ocean...
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.
I was there that day.
The ocean chose you.
I thought it was a dream.
(YELPS)
Nope!
Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...
at the bottom of his hook.
Follow it, and you will find him.
But why would it choose me?
I don't even know how to make it past the reef.
But I know who does!
