-- We make our nets from the fibers<br />-- We weave our nets from the fibers
-- The water is sweet inside<br />-- A real tasty treat inside
-- We use the leaves to build fires<br />-- We sing these songs in our choirs
-- To cook up the meat inside<br />-- We have mouths to feed inside
-- The village believes in us<br />-- That's right
The village believes
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves
So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me<br />And when I think of tomorrow
There we are
I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Where we are
'Cause every path leads ya back to
Where you are
You can find happiness right
Where you are
Where you are
