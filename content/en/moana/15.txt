There's a line where the sky meets the sea
And it calls me
But no one knows
How far it goes
All that time wondering where I need<br />to be is behind me
I'm on my own
To worlds unknown
Every turn I take<br />Every trail I track
Is a choice I make
Now I can't turn back<br />from the great unknown
Where I go alone<br />Where I long to be
See her light up the night in the sea
She calls me
And yes, I know
That I can go
There's a moon in the sky<br />And the wind is behind me
Soon I'll know
How far I'll go
