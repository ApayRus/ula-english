1.36 3.07 (ROARING)
10.58 14.09 I have crossed the horizon to find you
21.34 23.72 I know your name
27.52 31.35 They have stolen the<br />heart from inside you
36.11 39.19 But this does not define you
42.78 46.78 This is not who you are
48.45 53.71 You know who you are
60.55 63.22 Who you truly are.
