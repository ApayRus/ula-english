Moana
Make way, make way
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song
Who needs a new song This old one's all we need
This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we weave our baskets
The fishermen come back from the sea
I wanna see
Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
-- And there you are<br />-- There you are
There comes a day
When you're gonna look around<br />And realize happiness is
Where you are
Consider the coconut
-- The what<br />-- Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut<br />It's all we need
We make our nets from the fibers
The water is sweet inside
We use the leaves to build fires<br />We cook up the meat inside
Consider the coconuts
The trunks and the leaves
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves
That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well-provided
And when we look to the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness<br />right where you are
I like to dance with the water<br />The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous<br />Ha! I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy<br />Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like<br />Well, there you are
You are your father's daughter<br />Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember<br />You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper<br />To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside<br />is who you are
