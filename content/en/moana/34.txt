Maui!
You came back.
(CHUCKLES)
But your hook.
One more hit and...
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.
(TE KĀ ROARING)
I got your back, Chosen One.
Go save the world.
Maui.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Cheeeehoooo!
(SCREAMING)
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!
Hey, Te Kā!
Shark head!
Cheeeehoooo!
(GROANS)
Moana!
Get the heart to the spiral!
Te Fiti...
it's gone.
MAUI: Te Kā!
(SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Let her come to me.
