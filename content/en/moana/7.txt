Well, it's not like you said it<br />in front of your dad.
Standing on a boat.
I didn't say go beyond the reef,<br />because I want to be on the ocean.
But you still do.
(MOANA SIGHS)
-- He's hard on you because...<br />-- Because he doesn't get me.
Because he was you.
Drawn to the ocean.
Down by the shore.
He took a canoe, Moana.
He crossed the reef...
and found an unforgiving sea.
Waves like mountains.
His best friend begged<br />to be on that boat.
Your dad couldn't save him.
He's hoping he can save you.
Sometimes...
who we wish we were,<br />what we wish we could do...
it's just not meant to be.
