I see what's happening Yeah
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes Let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair The bod
When you're staring at a demigod
What can I say except
You're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high?
This guy
When the nights got cold<br />Who stole you fire from down below?
You're looking at him yo
Oh also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except<br />You're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray<br />It's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome
Well come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground<br />Oh that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel<br />I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree<br />Now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?<br />What is the take away?
Don't mess with Maui<br />when he's on a breakaway
And the tapestry here on my skin<br />Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been<br />I make everything happen
Look at that<br />Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'
Ha ha Ha ha
Ha ha<br />Hey
Well anyway let me say<br />You're welcome
You're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay<br />You're welcome
You're welcome
Well come to think of it<br />I gotta go
Hey it's your day to say<br />You're welcome
You're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away away<br />You're welcome
You're welcome
'Cause Maui can do everything but float
-- You're welcome<br />-- You're welcome
-- You're welcome<br />-- You're welcome
Huh?
